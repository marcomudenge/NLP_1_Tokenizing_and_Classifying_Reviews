Five Stars,good as any name brand,5
Did The Job,"Ordered on accident when I had searched for RECHARGEABLE batteries. Not happy. I will be less free about ordering on Amazon from now on. My fault, but it made my put up my guard.",3
Great product,"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed.",5
Leaking Acid EVERYEWHERE!!,After 2nd recharge and use all but 3 are leaking corrosive fluid which has ruined my charger.,1
One Star,They fail earlier than brand names. I assumed Amazon would match in beat others. I won't order again.,1
It's okay,I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.,3
Gift,Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.,5
Battery pack was missing,This item arrived with no battery pack. There is no way to power the toy without it because you can't just use regular batteries.,1
Hard to set up,I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help,3
Shortest lasting batteries I've ever used,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die.",1
Five Stars,reliable affordable,5
More ideal for a child or teen.,This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,1
Decent Kids Edition,"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected.",3
Great batteries. I'm not a big fan of disposable ...,"Great batteries. I'm not a big fan of disposable batteries, but unfortunetly big companies keep on making products that require the use of disposable batteries.",5
Decent tablet but not high caliber,"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast.",3
"Just as good as any other batteries, better for the price","Absolute best value for standard batteries (especially when using subscribe and save). If you aren't seeking rechargeable, I haven't ever been able to distinguish any real difference in quality or longevity between these and other top brands of batteries (Duracell, Energizer, etc.).Between my kids toys and my Xbox controllers, we go through about all of these batteries in about 6 months, so subscribe and save is the way to go.",5
"cheap, easy, slow",Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.,3
Good Buy,Great!!,5
Not worth the unless it's a special,Just ok,3
Great for a 5 year old,My granddaughter loves it and she's learning a lot,5
I do not recommend this,These have a very short life. I do not recommend this brand,3
Five Stars,power-full,5
One Star,Do not last near as long as other 'off brand' batteries,1
Good First Tablet,"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK.",3
none of them work.,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.",1
Disappointing ripoff,"These batteries were a huge disappointment. I used two in my amazon tv remote and they lasted only 2 weeks. Usually, I only need to change batteries in that remote every 3-4 months or so. Total ripoff.",1
... my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries,Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries . I also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries. Tv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long...,3
Stay away,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it,1
Didnt work for more than 10 minutes,Ive gone thru half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Wasted money on something i needed.,1
I bought it as a gift,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.,3
I've had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers,"I've had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it's a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won't take another chance with them.",1
Cheap batteries that are cheaply made,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them.",1
Great First Tablet,I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.,3
My remote now works! Only needed batteries.,Best way to have electronics work is having them be charged or have batteries! Buying this pack will fix the needing batteries part!,5
Good for kids 6 to 10,Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it,5
Dead on Arrival,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window.",1
One Star,Trash. Only lasted a few hours.,1
Bad quality,Many of the batteries are no good.,1
Fire tablet,Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.,3
Good pics. we will see how long that last,Good pics.we will see how long that last..,5
Good Value!,Great value for high volume of batteries.,5
Great price,The price of the item was very good compared to other cages however the item itself came tilted so now my dog has a tilted dog crate. The tilt to the gates are noticeable but not very drastic. For the price I'll live with it.,3
I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors ...,"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss.",1
Super slow,It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.,1
Great!!!,Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.,5
Much faster,The screen is great outside but the biggest difference is the speed of page refresh. Having the page turn buttons back on the side is awesome!,5
Bought for wife,Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.,5
Amazon Batteries,I always try to buy Amazon rechargeable batteries. Good price and lasts a long time between charges. Saves a bit of the environment compared to disposable ones.,5
Great tablet,I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.,5
Great tablet,"Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies.",5
CHEAP FOR A REASON,Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.,1
Great for kids,I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.,3
Excellent tablet for its price,This is a great tablet for the price. Only caveat is the amazon ads that come with it.,5
Batteries,Such a great value!!!,5
Zero Star-All dead,Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.,1
WORST ALKALINE BATTERIES EVER TRIED. SAVE YOUR,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline,1
AmazonBasicsAAA,All Good,5
Enough said,Their batteries,3
One Star,They don't work and are dead!!!!!!,1
I'll tell you AFTER I've tried them.,I miss the bunny with the drum.,3
The camera is awful!,Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks,3
Slow! Don't waste you money!,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.",1
Five Stars,Great value for the money.,5
No No NO!!!!!!,we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!!,1
Kindle Fire 8,"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this.",5
Great kids tablet,I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .,3
A good cheap tablet.,"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product.",3
Good price,"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook",3
Easy to use,Bought this for my 1year 7 months he loves it so much,5
Hard to open!,They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.,3
Don't last long,Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.,1
Three Stars,Seems to work well,3
"So, I now have an angry 2 year old ...","So, I now have an angry 2 year old. A broken new toy. And batteries that I cannot trust. I put new batteries in the toy and it stopped working a couple days later. I opened it up to find some batteries leaked also ruining the toy.Edit: Amazon has made since replaced the batteries for me.",1
I like it,I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show,3
Just ok,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget,3
non functional!!!,horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties,1
Not really statisfied with features,Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it,1
These are as bad as batteries can get.,"Do not use these in any techy gadget, including remote controls, keyboards, and especially cameras!",1
... what is going to happen with my charger not satisfied with the,3 of them exploted and damage my charger that I bought here what is going to happen with my charger not satisfied with the batteries,1
Great starter for the 5-7 y/o,"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included",5
Three Stars,I like how i got so many itd months later and i still got a pack left!!,3
Five Stars,Great deal and good batteries.,5
The remote lasted for like a week,"I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks.",1
I mean.. batteries They work.,I mean..batteries They work.,3
Great,We love these batteries!,5
Loses WI Fi Constantly,"The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection.",3
Short life,They really don't last very long,3
Okay,"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available",3
Five Stars,Work great.,5
Wish it had more,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.,3
I purchased these for the office as everyone has an ...,"I purchased these for the office as everyone has an Apple mouse that uses AA batteries. I found myself changing batteries on my mouse almost every month with these batteries. Yes they work, but not for long. We purchased these in September and we blew through these in 2.5 months with 16 employees. With Duracell batteries, which I purchased again, they last much longer, several months instead of just one month.",3
Great tablet for kids,Great tablet for kids they love it it is also great that you can download music and movies through Amazon Prime,5
Three Stars,So far they have worked well. I do not know how to compare them on quality yet.,3
worked fine,ok for the price,3
Not like other android tablets,This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.,1
Easy to use,This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.,5
Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",1
Amazon is amazing,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others.",3
Five Stars,Great price for that many battery's they last along time,5
Kindle Fire HD8,This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.,5
Three Stars,Does not last long,3
Great for my child,Loved it! Great product for my 10 year old son!!!!,3
I don't know who made these batteries but they are ...,I don't know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.,1
Great tablet,Well made and profrssional looking. Operating manual clear and complete.,5
Five Stars,they work,5
amazon fire hd8,meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.,3
Quality batteries for great price!,Batteries are so expensive. It's great that Amazon came out with their own brand that is cost effective and has great quality! I've only used a few of them so far but they are definitely long lasting! Will reorder again.,5
Disappointed,Don't bother. The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries.,1
all of them where dead wouldn't run anything,all dead,1
Good value.,Did not last as long as expected but good value for price.,3
Super Nice Tablet,"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one.",5
ok,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.,3
Five Stars,"good batteries for the price, no better deal around",5
Perfect Tab,"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it.",3
good starter tablet,"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it",3
There is a santa,"I bought this for my special needs son. He keeps kissing it saying,"" I love you tablet"". Could not be happier. Setup is a breeze. Very easy forkids to use and enjoy.",5
Five Stars,Great cost and great batteries,5
Still prefer iPad or android tablet,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",3
Three Stars,They dont last long but they are cheap,3
"Purchase a new one, stay away from the refurbished fire tv.","Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :).",1
"WORST PURCHASE OF BATTERIES IN HISTORY, BUYER BEWARE!","I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly IT DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR MY DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS OF AAA BATTERIES. At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!",1
I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it,They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!!,1
Kids need credit card?,"Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever.",1
great tablet,"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop.",5
Three Stars,This is OK purchased as battery does not last long with cost paid.,3
Slow but durable,Kindle fire is slow but love the fact my child is protected from some internet content,3
It's good for shopping... on Amazon,"Get this for shopping and fun, not for productivity. This is an inexpensive tablet chocked full of bloatware and ads. I got it for the wife and she uses it to play mini games and shop, and that's what it's meant for so mission accomplished.The GOOD: It's cheap. Fairly good battery life. Fairly decent screen. Quick charge time.The BAD: It always has some sort of advertising for amazon shopping - annoying at times. Sound quality is terrible. Made of super slippy material, hard to hold; get a case for this or you will drop it; often. Amazon only apps. No android or IOS apps will work with this. It's kinda slow. No YouTube.Overall: If you need a simple tablet for light web browsing, shopping, music, movies, reading and small games then this will work fine. As a primary productivity tablet, forget it. Get something way more robust than this.",3
Its an ok tablet.,"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults.",3
Great tablet for a simple user,"I love how thin it is. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 and honestly I like this one better. Its simple, has a beautiful user interface, and it multitasks well. The battery life is great. Very loud speakers to be a tablet. Its much different from an iPad or Android tablet, it took a little bit of exploring to fully figure everything out, and the settings are more limited but it works for what I need. The only con I've found so far is that the Appstore is more limited than Apple or Google Play but I haven't had a problem finding similar apps.",5
Pretty annoying!,"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!",1
Difficult to navigate,It's difficult to navigate and not user friendly. I was hoping for better results,3
Dead batteries for 10,All the batteries came dead. None of them worked. Don't bother buying these.,1
Great tablet,Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up,5
Five Stars,Great,5
One Star,Batteries very week. Would Not Work IN Several devices.,1
Worth the money. Very fun for the kids,My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.,5
"Ok for reading, not so much for browsing","good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing.",3
ok tablet for a small child,The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.,3
batteries don't last long! Not a good Value,This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.,1
My nieces love it,"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price.",5
waste of money,"Waste of money,You tube does not work on these tablets,so everything from there old tablet does not work on the new ones,so going back to the old ones and sending these back",1
I love it,I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,3
Love kids mode,I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts,3
works great,work great thank you,5
Three Stars,Battery's charge ran out very quickly.,3
One Star,they do not last at all would love to get my money refunded.,1
Kids 1st tablet approved,Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it,3
One Star,took WAY to long to receive. and then some were corroded.,1
Ok for your remote.,"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on.",3
"For what they are, great buy!","It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great.",5
Great price.,Great price for these alkaline batteries. Being that they are AAA there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control. I found that the AA amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries.,3
Not as I expected,"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radios.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Noqw I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys.",3
Awesome batteries!,"These batteries are a great deal! The price is very reasonable and the life of the batteries are just as good as any major brand. Now that I have tried these out, I will purchase the amazon brand for all my future battery needs.",5
One Star,Batteries die super fast!,1
Three Stars,TV Clicker about 2 months,3
"Batteries are great, price isn't the best","Batteries are great, price isn't the best. I've seen similar packs of generic batteries for cheaper. Wegmans comes to mind..",3
I have never been so disappointed with a product,"I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in tv remotes, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again.",1
Great,We are a big fan of this tablet. The cost was great and if we ever do run out of space for whatever reason we can purchase more.,5
Amazon is on Fire,The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.,5
Awful,Not good,1
Do not buy!!!,Bought these batteries thinking they were a good price. I have two deodorizer devices that spray a tiny amount every :20 minutes. I put these batteries in one and a brand name in the other. The name brand batteries have not been changed yet ant these batteries have gone through 4 pairs. Name brand are cheaper in the long run,1
Great starter tablet,Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need.,5
Too may preloaded useless apps,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",1
Fast Charger,Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great.,5
Not what I was expecting.,I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.,3
Three Stars,I don't feel Amazon brand batteries are as powerful as other brands.,3
Great tablet,The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.,5
Kids Tablet,It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.,3
hmm,"I'm not sure if these are the same Amazon Basics batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did.",1
A good cheap tablet.,"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product.",3
Fits perfectly in my hand,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there,3
Waste of money,Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me.,1
Too many pop up ads,We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.,3
Easy to use but limited,"Easy to use but more limited than a more powerful tablet such as a Galaxy or iPad. Video conferencing is rather difficult to do in my experience. However if you read digital books, watch videos, or listen to music it works well and the stereo sound with the larger versions is really nice.",3
C...R....A...P!!!,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!,1
Disappointing,"These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researched the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on",1
I like it,I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show,3
Small screen for books and videos,"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft.",3
dead,This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back,1

Confused,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.,1

Don't last,These are terrible. Don't last Put then in various items and their life is only 1/2 half of a Duracell,1
Three Stars,Find these batteries have to be replaced more frequently than other bands when used in the same application/device.,3
Product is of bad quality. I had two leaking in 2 months after installing.,This is sth i never had with other serious brands. disappointing and returning,1
SAVE YOUR MONEY - GARBAGE PRODUCT,Junk...save your money... totally useless batteries that last hours if that.,1
Nice!,Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.,5
I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries ...,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work.",1
Leaked Battery Acid Every Time,Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.,1
Product Issues,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,1
kids fun,Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better,3
disappointment,These batteries are not lasting at all.... very short life on them... super disappointed...,1
Five Stars,excellent value,5
These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast,"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste.",1
Yay amazon!,"I was super excited to try these Amazon brand items and I'm sure glad they are branching out. I really just dislike Walmart and they terrible customer service. So typically I purchase batteries from BJ as I have two kids with tons of toys! Amazons prices for their batteries beats BJS by 5 to 6 depending on the size plus even at BJs you can't get a 48 pack of AA. The packaging was and simple which is fine because it does nothing for me. I must say that I like opening the package better with Amazon than normal batteries because I hate the thick plastic it's hard to cut and sometimes sharp, plus Amazons packaging is better for the environment. I just installed some batteries yesterday and I'll update as to how long they last",5
One Star,terrible,1
The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very ...,The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. For some items they don't work at all. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again.,3
Three Stars,The sound quality could be better. It's cute though...,3
Good luck!,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get.",3
hate it,"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",1
Waste of money,These batteries don't last long. Waste of money.,1

Duracell batteries last longer than these.,Duracell batteries last longer than these.,3
Chronic issue with charging port,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",1
Stick with a name brand,Worst batteries I've ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control.,1
Not for Comixology owners - only buy when on sale,"Bought it for $50 to replace my aging Kindle Fire HDX 7. Was excited about the size (1"" larger), faster processor, and expandable storage.I should have read the reviews. Comixology purchases only download to the internal storage, not external - 16 GB fills up after 8 downloads. The screen resolution is noticeably pixilated when reading text.Still, one star for value if bought for $50, one star for build (solid), and one if you're a Amazon Prime member & able to take advantage of video & music (which will download to external memory).",3
"Great Speaker, no need for the tech",Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that,3

... first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases,"When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others). I have not done any tests, but feel some other brands may last longer. However, the price is hard to beat.",3
Great bumper,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.,3
Three Stars,nothing bad to say but I can get others for cheaper price.,3
easy set up and user friendly,suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion,5
Ok,How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!,3
piece of junk,"I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help.",1
Three Stars,Weird but some didn't last long as they should,3
Five Stars,They work - that's about it.,5
Very disappointing purchase,"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me.",1
Dead On Arrival,It's seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I'm putting them in. Fairly disappointed,1
Bah,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.,1
Great for kids,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.,3
Very awesome!,"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!",5
Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast,Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. We put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it's not on for long. We used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn't have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again.,1
Haven't set it up yet,It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.,3
Not as good as I'd hoped,I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.,3
Nice Amazon Fire Tablet !,Its a good one but didn't set for my 6 year old.So had to return it back !,3
ok,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.,3
Not a bad product,I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.,3
Kind of complicated,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.",3
OK but not great,"I have a digital charger that has been very effective at recharging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a recharge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxell and others, I expected a more robust container.",3
safe and eco-friendly,"These batteries are safe for children, because it features an anti-leakage style. Plus, it's eco-friendly so it's not just good for your child, buy also in your surrounding.",5
Good tablet,This was not the best choice for my autistic son. We were unable to download anything from Google Play and were limited to the Amazon store. Making this a deal breaker for us. I had to return it and get a different tablet.,3
It's ok.,"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.",3
Great Buy!,Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!,5

Worst device Amazon has produced.,"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need.",1

No hidden fees.,1

Not user Friendly,"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs.",1
Kindle Fire HD Just OK,"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice.",3
Perfect,I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with,5
Waste of money,Awful. Have almost gone through a whole box to find a battery or two that actually work.,1

Disappointing!,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time.",1

Horrible,Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!,1
It's okay,I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.,3
Someone can't count! Only 12 of 36 batteries were in the box! Past orders have been correct.,"Came with only 12 of the 36 batteries in the box. Someone can't count. Two previous orders came with all 36, which warrants a 3 rating overall I suppose.",3
Horrible.,"Batteries were horrible. As soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I'd get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn't even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks.",1
Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",1

I use them for my xbox one controller I play a lot. the first ones I used lasted pretty long I can't tell you how long exactly but it had to be around 6 or 7 days playing for about 3 sometimes 4 hours a day so I'd say that's pretty good. Im using my second ones now still pretty good so 5 stars all the way for me,5
Very please with our new Kindle Oasis,easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon.,5
"Very slow , resolution bad",It's 2017 no reason this tablet cannot produce clear 1080 or higher resolution. I get it it's cheap and for that it's good but it just feels cheap and omg so manny pop up adds.. Comeon amazon,1
Bah,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.,1
Buy ANY Other Kind of Batteries,"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!!",1
One Star,They don't last. I would not buy again,1
Not Bad But A Little Too Bulky,"There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basics laptop and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive.

My normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one.",3
Good price,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality,3

Perfect for my first tablet,Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...,5
Do not buy Amazon Basics batteries.,Might as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I'll never order another Amazon basics battery.,1

A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again.",1
Five Stars,great batteries and haven't had any leak yet like other off price or off brand ones.,5

"Die quickly, most of them didn't even work out of the package.","They didn't last long, do not waste your money!! Die quickly, most of them didn't even work out of the package!!",1
Great tablet,I would highly recommend this kindle. It is user friendly and not to big. But large enough to see easily,5
Awesome for kids. Keeps them entertained,Was iffy at first. But so glad a I got my kids these pads,5
Stick with Duracell/Energizer...,"Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. (LED candles, on continuously).",1
"So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was ...","So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase.",1
Save your money,This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.,1
Great tablet for a Toddler,Very pleased with product. I was also a decent price and not overpriced.,5
Basically a big phone...without the phone,This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.,3
Short life!!,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it.",1
Be aware these require a credit card,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it.",1
Wonderful tablet for kids,I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.,5
Great every day tablet,This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great,5
Stay Away - Leaking acid issues from multiple cells,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess.",1
Three Stars,GOOD USE,3
Good quality alkaline batteries - and excellent considering the price.,Good quality alkaline batteries.,5
Not good,I ordered these batteries 2 months ago. I don't really have a lot of things that require AAA batteries. My tv remote finally died and I put in these batteries. And my remote tells me that these brand new batteries are low.,1
OK for general uses..,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK.",3
Five Stars,good price. good product.,5
Five Stars,Work as advertised and fair price.,5
Fun and amazing!,"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",5
I don't understand all the great reviews,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.,3
Three Stars,Just normal batteries a little higher priced than I could get elsewhere,3
Slow performance,Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times,3
Shipped with a bad battery,One of my 48 batteries arrived with what looks like a leak. The rest look fine so I'll just keep them. Otherwise these batteries work just fine.,3
Good tablet for what it does,"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy.",3
"Good Batteries, Better Deal",I was expecting less performance giving that these are the cheapest batteries I can find but I'm pleasantly surprised with the life of these batteries.,5
Not Duracells but cheaper,They don't last as long as a Duracell but they are cheaper.,3
App options pathetic,Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed,1
It's a really good tablet.,My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.,5
Three Stars,I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.,3
One Star,Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!!,1
Slow at first,When I finally opened and started the process it took forever to load apps but when it finally finished it was fine,3
"iPad ""lite""","This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there.",3
Dead after 3 days,Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.,1
not as good as I would of liked for what I need ...,"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Fast , good delivery.",3
One Star,Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option.,1
One Star,Very dissappintes with these. Have had to replace almost all of them.,1
Small screen for books and videos,"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft.",3
Handy size tablet,This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-),5
No Power,I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true.,1
Worked Great!,Worked great!,5
returned item,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.,1
Don't throw your money away on these batteries.,They lasted less than 24 hours in my mouse and that includes turning the mouse off overnight! What a ripoff.,1
They missed on this one,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.,3
never have enough,stock up,5
Bottom expands as well,This folder also expands on the bottom. Will allow A LOT more than when the bottom does not expand. Bought a second. I recommended this to my friends.,5
Great batteries at a consistent price!,These are great! They work just as long as the other brands. I really think they last longer but I have no proof! One thing I love is the price and how Amazon does not change the price all the time. They have sales sometimes but when I run out I can always come back and get the at least the same price if not lower and that means alot to me! I really do not like battery price shopping all the time and this makes it so easy! I hope that helps! ray333ray2001yahoo.com,5
Three Stars,I think it was recargable,3
Not for overseas!,"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!",1
"Love the Amazon 8"" HD","It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality.",5
stopped working after 3 weeks.,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,3
One Star,Wore out way to fast,1
Reading lover,My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!,5
Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received ...,"Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received, they do the job!",5
Very disappointed,"My Mother in Law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. We ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. Once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. She then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. Really disappointing and a huge hassle for her. Have never had batteries last such a short time. We were very unhappy.",1
Batteries fail after very short time,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again,1
Great tablet for kids,My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight,5
good for price,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.,3
Found what I needed.,Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.,3
One Star,About 1/3 the life of energized or Duracell batteries.,1
Tablet not for kids,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...,3
Three Stars,Inexpensive! But they die quickly.,3
Five Stars,Great product they last a long time!,5
Good tablet for kids,"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books.",3
Great for kids,Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet,5
Affordable Power,"I have 2 kids, and they have a lot of battery powered toys. We tried rechargeable batteries, and they didn't hold up like I was hoping. These batteries are more affordable than brands at the store, and I can't tell a difference in performance.",5
The WORST!!!,"Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn't last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it'll save you in the long run!",1
Work great!,They work just as good as Energizers,5
Good,It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab,3
The camera and Cover are great,Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.,3
Five Stars,Excellent product.,5
Decent tablet but not high caliber,"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast.",3
Happy kids,Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this,5
One Star,don't hold a charge - have to recharge too frequently,1
Great table,"this is my 2nd hd 8, very fast and easy, great value",5
No response,I bought four fire tablets and each of them stopped charging immediately after the purchase. I wrote to Best Buy detailing the problem with the tablets and the fact I did not have insurance or the boxes to return the item. No response. Disappointed because I have made major and multiple purchases with this company. Won't make any more purchases from Best Buy.,1
More bang for my buck...,"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shopper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remotes that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. So, finding some that were affordable was necessary to keep everyone happy.",5
One Star,These die way too fast.,1
Great computer,My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours,5
1st time user,Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.,5
Good product but hard to setup for Grandson,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products",3
Great Tablet with lots of functionality.,"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps.",5
Leak at base good for one use do not buy,Do not buy each have leaked within one recharge. Battery corrosion at base ruined my battery recharger as well. Warranty for 30 days. You can't use them all and recharge within 30 days,1
One Star,Sent me old dead batteries,1
Confusing for me; returning,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",3
Not sure I will be buying these again. The ...,Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won't be buying these again.,1
Don't Buy,"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results.",1
One Star,"As soon as i place the new battery in my card alarm, ut says 1 bar charged",1
Great Fire Tablet,"We purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. She took to it immediately. It connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5; search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the Fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. The camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey... Sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity.",5
"cheap, easy, slow",Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.,3
Best Tablet,This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child,5
Great for Children.,As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.,5
Poor quality control - a number of bad batteries in the batch.,"Bought these and regret it. I must have gotten a bad batch since these were lasting only three weeks in my smoke detectors. After a few weeks, all smoke detectors using them started beeping like they are low on power. A battery tester confirmed the batteries were low. I replaced them with store-bought Rayovac batteries and haven't had any issues.",1
great tablet,"good value for the money, love the kindle for reading",5
One Star,Does not last as long as the good batteries,1
Good for reading book,Prices are very reasonable better than other tablet,5
A good buy!,"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped.",5
Amazon Fire tablet,Too many Amazon advertisement that you can‚Äôt get rid of on this tablet. Took my 6 year old a long time to adjust to it as she was familiar with using my Apple Ipad.,3
Great product with a ton of features,Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it,5
Serves my tablet needs perfectly,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",5
I love it,I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,3
Defective,"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life.",1
Not an iPad by any means,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",3
GREAT PRODUCT AND PRICE,"Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service",5
Very good table for the price,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty.",3
Nice tablet,"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card.",5
1/4 Capacity Batteries,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",1
Awsome for my niece,My niece absolutely loves this plus all the in house benefits provided by Amazon u cant lose best bang for your buck when spending on a 12 year old . great for her school and entertainment . Amazon does it again,5
Best Tab for kids,This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.,5
Decent game so far,I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.,3
Defective.,"I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working. Perhaps they are old, but they are just plain not working. I put in a Duracell and my headphones work. I put any one of the 36 batteries in the headphones - and it is not working. It is not worth the effort to get my 10 back.",1
You get what you pay for.,Some of the batteries did not work well.,3

I'm going to return this and will not ...,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again.",1
Great for children,My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money,5
Beginner tablet,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok",3
Don't hold their charge,"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use.",1
Ok,Basic battery,3
Three Stars,Not bad i guess,3
Working great,So many new features compared to my old Kindle from 4yrs ago,5
"24 year old Bon Bons, anyone","Date on the back of these were 1992. Yeah, 1992. Inedible.",1
I use my Kindle every day.,This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.,5
Good for movies and amazon,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",3
Good value tablet,It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.,3
Terrible,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,1
very disappointed!!,"Amazon batteries are ok, they do not last as Duracell and i wish the have rechargeable ones , very disappointed!!",3
Ok product,"Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok",3

love this for games,My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!,5
Great purchase,My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.,3
Ok for Basics,"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet.",3
"AA batteries, good deal, what else could you want","Great deal, better than local stores",5
must buy,"i use to buy my batteries from Cvs, rite aid these are great quality and long lasting.",5
Long-lasting batteries that deserve a place in your electronics,These batteries last a long time and does not leak even after it runs out of juice. I use these to power my remotes and nightlights and have not experienced any problem whatsoever with it.,3
Three Stars,Didn't last as long as I would have liked,3
Good Price,Good cartridge by HP. Like being able to order online and then pick up at the store. Saves me running to the store only to find they might be out.,5
"Good hardware, bad software","The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...",3
Not as good as I'd hoped,I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.,3
Quality seems good. I just wish the buttons lit up on ...,"Quality seems good. I just wish the buttons lit up on the bagel and frozen buttons. Also, the slots aren't long enough or deep enough for a good sized bagel.",3
Had to return in a week,This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying.,1

Terrible,"I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can't lie and say they were awesome, when they were not.",1
but seem fine so far,"Not sure how long these last yet, but seem fine so far. I like the box they come in that is strong, but then they put hard plastic wrap on 4 packs of the battery that are a pain to remove. Get out your knife, don't cut yourself.",3
Bought these for my sisters day care. She said ...,"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received",1
Perfect for the kids,"Bought 2 of these for my grandkids for Christmas. These are perfect and with the sale I bought them on, even better. I liked the 8 since the screen is a little bigger plus more memory than the 7.",5
No support for these batteries - buyer beware,"Im sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and theres no way for me to request a replacement.",1
Not good,Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.,1
Died in 2 days or less!,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.,1
I like it but....,Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.,3
Five Stars,Great Price!,5

Three Stars,So far they have worked well. I do not know how to compare them on quality yet.,3
Shoddy Asia Product,"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with.",1

It awesome,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,5
Five Stars,good for the price,5
Great Upgrade from Paperwhite,"Though not super noticible the resolution is better on the voyage. Also the fact that the screen doesn't dip in and is flat all the way across was a huge plus for me, having a toddler that spills stuff on it if I leave it lying around. The page turn button features on the sides are kinda pointless though. All in all, love it!",5
Child loves this,He is an Apple lover but the fact that you can download things for when you aren‚Äôt connected to WiFi is the big winner! He‚Äôs grown to love it !,5
Great tablet for little kids,"Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!",5
The tablet not so great as mentioned,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow",1

This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer.",1
"I love you, but these batteries are terrible","Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC",1
Tabrej Ali,Pros: Very satisfied I am about buy online this side wonderful service good Quality seal pack and good packing Cons: Great Other Thoughts: I am satisfied thanks,5
Received dead batteries,Both packs were useless. Confirmed low charge with multimeter.,1
Useful aid,"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge.",5
Horrible,So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions,1

Leaky batteries,"I like these batteries, but a couple of times now after putting them in I have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside, I figured it was just a one off, but it has now happened several times, I am reluctant to use them anymore in case I damage items",1
Great Tablet,You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!,5
My daughter loved it!,This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.,5
Fire Tablet,Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.,3
Three Stars,Bought as a gift to go with the vibrator.,3
Amazon Basic products rule!!,Not the first time I have bought Amazon Basic products and won't be the last. From my experience these products do just as well as any name brand product but with less experience. Love the packaging these batteries came in and so far from what I can tell work like a charm. Put them in a couple of my gadgets and worked perfectly. The way we go through batteries the cost savings is well worth it.,5
"Good buy, works well.",I always forget to buy batteries at the store. So easy to buy on Amazon. Changed all my batteries on my devices and everything is working great again.,5
I like it but....,Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.,3
My first eReader is eXCEPTIONAL!,"Wow! it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carries tons of books! No distractions like on my iPad, with email messages pinging in and facebook updates to check...just books and lots of them!The Kindle Voyage is everything they said it would be...light, back lit with self adjusting levels, page turners, all the bells and whistles. I am so glad I waited and splurged for this one!",5
Waste of money,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.,1
Five Stars,"Perfect battery, we trust the choice of Amazon basics.",5
"Decent tablet, HORRIBLE warranty","Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way",3
Batteries fail after very short time,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again,1
One Star,"These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast",1
Great for school work and games.,"It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games.",5
These r the worst batteries ever,These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..,1
Three Stars,i meant to order AA and not AAA.I shall reorder,3
Very disappointed.,Many of these batteries are not working at all. Very disappointed.,1
"Economy batteries, less actual mAh than competitors",Does not last as long as name brands such as Duracell and Energizer.,3
terrible product.,Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product.,1
Perfect purchase,My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.,5

Five Stars,Good deal on functional batteries,5
Awesome reader,Love my new kindle!!! I would recommend this to anyone who reads ebooks or has audible.,5
"Get the Fire HD 8, Not the 10","We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.",3
Five Stars,great quality. Holds nice long charge,5
One Star,Very weak batteries,1
"These are NOT rechargeable, even though they look similar to those.","This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference.",3
Luv this,Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage,5
they work,they work,3
Great for kids,Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn't be happier,5

Ok but they don't last long at all,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.,1
Great value,I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.,5
It's better to buy Duracell,You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.,1
Purchased for Christmas presents,Just right for my under 10 nieces and nephew. Great investment.,5
Three Stars,Worth the price,3
excellent for 5-8 years,"offers a lot for the price, good parental controls",5
One Star,these were dead on arrival,1
Three Stars,poor quality short life cannot recharge,3
Fits perfectly in my hand,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there,3
Not performing,I have a simple electronic keypad I use these batteries in. With the name brand I would go about 2 months. With the amazon brand i go 2 weeks. Not sure I am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet.,3
Defective,"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life.",1
Don't depend on these.,I put two of these in my small flashlight and they only lasted about 15 minutes. Waste of money.,1
Five Stars,as advertised,5
They don't last,"They don't last. USed in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboards) Energizer or Duracell last easily 3x longer. Not worth the savings. If its going in some kids game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyways) ok.",1
No impressed.,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.,3
First one out of the box I placed in a ...,"First one out of the box I placed in a Swissphone Fire department pager. Battery indicator had 3 levels, and a new battery only shows 2 bars. That's rather disappointing, I should have stuck with Duracell, they show full charge.",3
"Leaky, short life batteries.","These batteries are the worst of any I've ever bought. They have corroded inside of toys, remotes, noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I've tried AA and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. So needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries. If you care about life and not having to mess with corrosion, do not buy these batteries!!!",1
Right size and weight,Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old,5
Tablet not for kids,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...,3
Short life,They really don't last very long,3
17 less battery life than Duracell,"I put these batteries in 10 of the 12 window candles that I bought - I put my last 2 Duracell in the other 2. The Amazon Batteries lasted for about 10 days and the Duracell lasted for 12. Since then I've experimented to see if this is consistent . It is, the Duracell last an average of 17 longer.",3
Very poor performance. Would not recommend.,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these.",1
Five Stars,Great value and they work as good as any other brand!,5
One Star,"bad product, not working in the remote car where it required 3 AA batteries.",1
Don't waste your money on these,"These batteries are supposed to be 1.5 volts. But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 volts upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.Don't waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name brands.",1
"Tablet worked as it should, but...","I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet.",3
Nice gadget,My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...,5
Poor Quality - Barely Holds a Charge,Horrible quality. These last 4 to 6 days in an Xbox controller and maybe 10 days in a remote. Horrible quality.,1
One Star,don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.,1
Great,"Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!",5

Three Stars,Can not tell the difference between these batteries and the name brands,3
Batteries for days,Same price to buy all these as it is to buy an 8pack at the store. Why pay more They same to have a similar lifespan. I haven't noticed any difference.When I retire in 30 years I'll probably buy an other case to get me through my last years. But these should last until then.,5

For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not ...,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem,3
Best Kindle yet,"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.",5
HD fire 8,Love the beautiful color of this tablet. Features are also great for a tablet like this.,5
These work great and last long!,These batteries are exactly what you would expect. I have not had any issues with them not lasting long. I would recommend these to anyone looking to purchase batteries.,5
Cheap batteries that are cheaply made,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them.",1
Just doesn't last as long as other brands,"I haven't done any scientific research on how long these last compared to other batteries, I can only give you my layman's experience. I use the exact same amount of battery usage every day and have tried pretty much every brand of battery (I don't hear that well so I wear headphones for my television and I wear them the same number of hours per day).The AmazonBasics batteries don't last nearly as long as any other battery. My headphones start getting fuzzy about twelve hours earlier than they normally would with any other the batteries I've ever used. I went through this package a week earlier than I would a 24-pack of either Duracell or Energizer. In some usages this might not matter but for me, it just wasn't worth it to buy these.",3
It is a Christmas gift,This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.,3

Worst product. Have to trash it out,"Worst product. Have to trash it out, because I was so upset. Did not serve the propose I bought it for.",1
Works,Speakers stuck on this thing . I bought it to give to my grandma but she found it too difficult.,3
Worst batteries I've ever purchased!,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.,1
Excellent Tablet for the money,"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong.",5
TERRIBLE DONT BUY,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...",1

Five Stars,Great price.,5
Great item,Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it.,5

Good for entry level reader,This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.,3
This is a basic tablet for someone that doesn't re,I got this for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift. He liked it but doesn't use the internet much & has a smart phone so I returned. It's good for someone looking for something basic,3
Does not last too long,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.,3
"Had one already, like it.","Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild.",5
Reading again,Ergonomic and easy to get new books. My house is full of books and I need to quit stockpiling them. And I can't remember what I read years ago. This device helps.,5
didn't work,This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.,1
nice,good batteries,5
Five Stars,"Great price, lets see long they hold a charge.",5
Not user Friendly,"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs.",1
Chronic issue with charging port,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",1
Five Stars,Good value.,5
awesome,asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Three Stars,love it,3
Love kindle,Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go.,5
Perfect tablet for kids,"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids.",5
Fun for beginner,Its very cool great picture good sound. Was kind of disappointed that i couldnt make calls but overall great piece of hardwark,1
Five Stars,best battery value I have found.,5
Not kid friendly,"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too.",1
Low Quality Batteries. See Pics. You have been warned.,Picture for proof. I had these in an Amazon basics wireless mouse and one of them exploded. It was only in there about 3 months before I noticed the batteries were dead. Upon inspection it was clear one of the batteries had a structural failure and exploded the end apart leaking fluid inside mouse.This mouse has NEVER been out of my air conditioned office.I have never had a battery explode inside a mouse before. These are obviously low quality. Do not put them into anything you'd be upset to ruin with leaky battery fluid.,1
Five Stars,Order these all the time Good Price,5
Three Stars,They ran out of energy very quick but it's a deal,3
Wonderful BC starter tablet,I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding,5
Battery Leaks,Leaked all over our lantern battery case. I purchased these batteries for an emergency since they had a long shelf life. I put 4 batteries into each of my lanterns and 2 each into my flashlights. I have multiple battery leaks between the lanterns and flashlights. I ended up spending over an hour cleaning up the battery cases and flashlights. I've purchased the AAA pack as well and don't seem to have the same problem.,1
Total waste of money,Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.,1
Amazon is amazing,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others.",3
My 18 month old loves this!,"My son loves this tablet, he will not put it down!",5
Not impressed,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.,1
Ok but not fantastic.,Pretty good but the batteries do get used up fairly quickly. I use them for wireless mics and they last for maybe 5 or 6 hours TOPS. I need to compare them with Duracell to really get an idea of their quality.,3
great battery,Good battery. Lasts just as long as more expensive brands.,5
Okay,"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available",3
"Not bad, just not my flavor of android.",This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.,3
Barely a day before I changed them out.,It states that the batteries last a while. But I use them for my TV remotes. And I ended up buying Energizer a few days later. They do not last. I changed batteries twice the day I got them in mail.The triple A were no better.,1
More ideal for a child or teen.,This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,1
Good tablet for what it's designed to do,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.,3
Excellent upgrade- super graphics,Upgraded after older version slowed. Excellent graphics and speed. Look forward to learning more about newer features.,5
They work fine so far.,No more going to the store for batteries for me. So far they have been working fine.,5
Great AAA batteries at a competitive price,Good quality. Great price! Will buy again.,5
Doesn't stay on,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired,1
Just ok for the price,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",3
Great tablet,I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt,5
I love my Kindle,I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here,5
did not hold charge,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month.

Three Stars,okay,3
Didn't work,Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired.,1
Very short charge life. Dead in no time.,"Lot's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me.",1
Great price,Excellent price,5
They don't seem to work except in very low energy ...,"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well",1
Great product,"This is the second time I am buying these batteries (for my noise cancellation headphones). No complaints on the product and the packaging is excellent - frustration free, as described.",5
Poor quality,These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries,1
and are working just like any other,"Batteries packaged well, and are working just like any other battery",5
Three Stars,They seem to die faster than most batteries.,3
Great for my dad,Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it.,5
Weak.,They're not strong enough to power my kids' toys... so far they only work with tv remotes. :(,1
Value,Never run out of batteries with this,5
Saved Me From Bear Attack,"So... One day I was camping in the Wild West on the Rocky Mountains in Colorado... I was carrying my trusty Power Rangers limited edition collectors sword. Out of nowhere... A bear attacked me. I grabbed my trusty sword, but it was out of batteries so it did not make the swoosh sounds that adds to the effect of my swing. So I hurriedly went to my trusty AmazonBasics AA batteries, and switched out the ones in my Power Rangers sword. My swooshing sounds were amazing, and I escaped with my life (not my leg but that's okay). Thank you AmazonBasics AA Batteries for saving a life.",5
Great bumper,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.,3
I need to cancel this auto shipment,I need to cancel this auto shipment,1
Excellent value,"Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value.",5
Perfect for my 3 year old,My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.,5
A great starter tablet for a youngster,Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.,5
Horrible Battery Life,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,1
Great deal on Batteries,Great deal for a parent of 2 girls that have toys that all seem to require AA or AAA cells.,5
Three Stars,"Okay, but do not last long.",3
It's an ok tablet for the price.,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.",3
I bought AA batteries in the same order and they work fine.,Not a long life at all. I bought AA batteries in the same order and they work fine.,1
"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast!","Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",1
Poor performance,Batteries seem to have very short life.........,1
Unused batteries dead after four months ... complete waste of money,"Do NOT waste your money on these. I bought a box of 48 in November of 2015. It is now March of 2016, and we've used about a third of them. The rest are all dead already. 10-year shelf life!!! ... nowhere close.",1
Good,good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad,3
Worst batteries I ever bought,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !",1
iT'S A BATTERY,IT'S A BATTERY,3
Good deal,Work great in my children's video game controllers last just as well as the name brand batteries,5
Unable to use it,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.,1
Get shorty,They are bad batteries. Not long lasting at all,1
Need guide/instructions,"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.",3
Five Stars,Amazon has the best deals on batteries and they work!!!,5
Five Stars,Thanks for the batteries Amazon! Now my battery operated lights and fans will work when I loose power!,5
Great Batteries,Amazon batteries run longer and cost less. I buy all my batteries from Amazon now!,5
Not so good!,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!,1
Five Stars,Best batery,5
Three Stars,The battery life was not as long as Duracell and energizer.,3
Its OK. Not much life in the batteries.,Its OK. Not much life in the batteries.,3
Bad quality,Many of the batteries are no good.,1
Great for kids!!,"lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!",5
Five Stars,good price seem to work fine,5
Great for kids,Both my 2 &7 year old play with them in the car. Watching movies or playing games.,5
Battery comparison,Batteries did not last anywhere near the length of the Duracell that we purchased. Did a side by side test and the Amazon batteries were down to 50 to where the Duracell batteries were still at 99. Will do some more testing to make sure the test were equal. We bought two new trail cameras and we put one set of Amazon's batteries in one camera and one set of the duracell batteries in the other. We will now switch the batteries in the cameras for the same time frame and see what the end result is.,3
Five Stars,good batteries,5
Don't Last Long,"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train.",1
Dead on arrival,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.,3
Just meh,Great for small gadgets and remotes. Don't expect to run anythinh more. Could handle a set of battery power hair clippers.,3
Easy to use,Worth the price. Added this to my collection mainly for audible books. Don‚Äôt like the OS much.,3
GOOD DECISION!,"I love to read books....paper and electronic (via my iPad), but had never owned a Kindle. When shopping at Best Buy, I mentioned to my husband that I might want to try a Kindle....went to another area and, when I returned, the Kindle VOYAGE was in our basket. OK so I though I would give it a try. I LOVE it! So compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ??? I highly recommend the VOYAGE to existing and pending Kindle readers. So many great features in such a small package!",5
Very basic,"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old.",3
Good basic staple but maybe not as long-lasting as Duracell,"Good price but I can't tell if these last as long as Duracell. AmazonBasics with Amazon Prime are a great deal though, and I'd probably buy them again. I haven't had any problems with corrosion or other concerns.",3
"Love AmazonBasic products and GreenWorks, etc. Amazon takes care of you!",As advertised!,5
Three Stars,They're batteries.,3
Sad,It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped,3
Worst Battery We've Ever Used!!!!!,Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer. I literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an Amazon AAA battery 2 days ago and its already out. We have to replace everything that has an Amazon battery constantly. Will not buy these again.,1
"Ok batteries, don't last","Price is good but I don't think these batteries perform as well as their peers. Reading reviews from actual electricians, I think they agree.I love Amazon products but wouldn't buy these again (unless they were more than half off their competitor's prices).",3
Not worth the savings,"On second use, silver liquid leaked out of batteries, almost ruining the motor of a breast pump.",1
Three Stars,ok,3
Three Stars,Needed them in a hurry - don't last that long.,3
Batteries that work. Seem to last the same as ...,"Batteries that work. Seem to last the same as other major brands, but cheaper to buy. A no-brainer.",5
Three Stars,I wouldnt say they are worse or better then name brand batteries. about the same,3
False advertising,I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn't realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else.,1
Five Stars,works well and is a value for money buy.,5
Very disappointed,It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on,3
Great product for great price,"Great product for a great price, you can't go wrong with amazon! I love it!",5
childrens kindle,great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.,5
Kid Kindle,My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!,5
Three Stars,"Doesn't hold the strength of Duracell, etc.",3
Doesn't stay on,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired,1
"Ho-Hum, Good & Bad","I can only compare my Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) to my two Fire HD 7 8 GB 2012 (2nd Gen) units.Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) - Pros- Wider screen - better for viewing movies.- Multiple small icons on home screen.- Around 50% more RAM- Can add microSD up to 256 GB (no need to buy 32 GB)- Good value w/ $20 discount: $59 is lot less than the Fire HD 2012.- Offers Alexa, but I haven't figured it out (I have a Fire Stick on HDTV).Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) - Cons- Same 1208 x 800, 720p HD resolution.- Only 1.3 GHz (2012 was 1.2 GHz)- Crummy front/rear cameras, no auto-focus; 2012 rear only, w/ auto-focus.- Retains panels of previously used screens: annoying to delete.- Can only send Prime videos to HDTV via Fire Stick.- No micro-HDMI port to send any content to HDTV- Held horizontal, all controls and wires are awkwardly located on one side.- Blue Shade (read at night) seems useless.- Amazon brand case is too expensive and does not stand well in portrait view.- Reviews for third party cases: sometimes expensive, almost always shoddy, usually fail at portrait viewWhere is the Amazon brand case with a fitted snap-on hard back and a fold over cover that offers true protection? I have them for my Paperwhite 2nd Gen and Fire HD 2012 - they are excellent. On/off and volume control buttons failed on one Fire HD 2012. The other 2012 works perfectly after six years. Paperwhite is fantastic.Note: Fire HD 10 32 GB with 1920 x 1200 and 1080 resolution offers much better viewing, but $150 is way too much. A current $80 discount for iPad 2017 makes Apple's entry model $249. I may try it.Bottom line: If it comes back to $59, the Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) is a worthwhile purchase.",3
"Very poor performance, not very long lasting.",Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.,1
Great product,I wish it was more user friendly for my 2 year old.,5
GREAT QUALITY,Work as great as other name brand batteries I've used.,5
Decent,"These work pretty well. They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy.",3
Five Stars,Just as advertised.,5
Great device,Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.,5
Very Poor battery life,"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it.",1
Returned,I returned this item because I couldn‚Äôt get a keyboard with a case to go with it.,3
This item is not my primary tablet but is adequate,This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.,3
One Star,These suck. Had for a week. Stopped working. Garbage.,1
Ok for what you pay,Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do,3
Okay,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",3
should have purchased sooner,For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet,5
Three Stars,ok,3
Great 16GB Tablet For the Price,This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.,5
not so wonderful,not so wonderful - I don't think these batteries last any longer than the ones I buy at the dollar stores.,3
Great tablet for speed,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,3
Tablet for children,I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it,5
Nice 7in tablet,Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.,5
Three Stars,Haven't Used Yet........,3
Not for kids,This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.,1
A cheap tablet,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.,3
Five Stars,work.,5
One Star,They paired these with a order that uses AA,1
send back,"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying.",1
Three Stars,They don't charge after 3 or 4 uses.,3
Five Stars,"Good or better than Durcell at much less cost. Made in Indonesia, not China.",5
Decent price for average grade battery and delivered so you dont have to leave the couch,They dont last as long as certain premium brands but they do OK. I wouldnt put them in critical apps like smoke detectors but for TV remotes and toys and all the other goofy modern distractions that regularly beg for AAs they are OK.,3
Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in ...,"Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Cheap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Menards.",1
Great,"Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too",5
i have allways been impressed with Amazon brand products.,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed,1
Just as good as name brand.,I might even say they're better than name brand based on the price and quantity you get. Use them in everything from kids toys to flashlights to gaming controllers.,5
Great tablet for my three year old!!,Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.,5
NOT WORTH IT,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",1
"Good quality, too many zippers","Too many zippers IMO. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open.",3
The camera is awful!,Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks,3
Thanks,"I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, gadgets, remotes and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected.",5
Not what I was looking for,"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.",3
This is pretty user friendly,This has been pretty easy for my kids to use and navigate. They really like it.,3
Very Happy With Purchase,Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.,5
One Star,These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.,1
"Decent, does the job","Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good.",3
Five Stars,"Good batteries, even better price. I will never buy batteries from anywhere else",5
I bought these batteries for my Fitbit scale and installed ...,I bought these batteries for my Fitbit scale and installed them as soon as they arrived. Typically I have to change the batteries every 6-8 months but I have already had to replace these. I won't be buying them again.,1
soso,works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.,3
Worst ever- no battery life- avoid these,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.,1
Perfect Tab,"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it.",3
Great and Affordable,"Just as good as name brand, for a fraction of the price.Have been using these in numerous items, from remotes, to children's toys, to beard trimmer. Work just as good as name brand, and as far as I can tell the same battery life. Will definitely purchase from now on.",5
Not for kids,This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.,1
Broke in 5 mos,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.,1
Three Stars,Good deal for outdoor solar lights.,3
WORST BATTERIES EVER.,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME.",1
Perfect,Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere,3
"Don't last quite as long, but DAMN, you ...","Don't last quite as long, but DAMN, you can buy three times as many as leading batteries. For our office staff, very worth it.",3
lAmazon Fire tablet - One of my Best Buy's,"Love this product, and don't know why it took so l",5
Not really ever ready!,"Gave these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I've gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won't repurchase.",1
Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are ...,"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again.",1
Three Stars,Works,3
Great Starter Tablet,"Perfect for children or for someone that is curious about trying something that isn‚Äôt an Apple iOS. Also great for someone that has an Amazone Prine memberships. If you want the FULL Android experience though, you should get a different tablet. You get what you pay for.",3
not good and good,the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great,3
Great tablet,"This tablet is perfect for the kids. Easy to use, dependable, and affordable.",5
Exactly as described. Using these batteries in one of ...,Exactly as described. Using these batteries in one of my remotes that seems to eat batteries on a bi-monthly basis. Definitely cheaper than buying from big box stores and work just as well.,5
Not kid friendly,"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too.",1
Good Batteries,These work just as well as the well known brands. I am glad Amazon offers a economical alternative.,5
Work well. Cost less.,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription.",5
Fits perfectly in my hand,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there,3
8 Month Storage Life,Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors).,1
great value,amazing price for pretty good batteries,5
Awesome!,My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.,5
Three Stars,It's a battery...,3
One Star,Wore out way to fast,1
Is it worth it,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.,3
"Best Kindle ever made, best e-Reader on the market","I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.",5
Three Stars,"battery drains out fast, unlike duracell",3
Three Stars,ok,3
"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received ...","I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package I'll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money",1
NEVER AGAIN,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far.",1
What was Amazon Thinking,Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.,1
Ok for the price,Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.,3
Kind of slow loading,For a five year old this worked fine but was a bit slow loading games. But 5 year olds these days want it immediately. Like the kid friendly free books and games. It worked well with downloaded Disney movies and Netflix. May have to get one for 2 year old suster they both live it,3
Would buy again,I like these batteries. I go through AA batteries a lot with my children's toys..,5
"These batteries are great, I used Duracell before for my remotes etc","These batteries are great, I used Duracell before for my remotes etc, but i am impressed with these, I am getting much longer life from them. I am updating this review, this will be the only battery I use, they last a long time, and are a good price!",5
kindle kids fire,it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad,3
Great batteries,These work well and seem to last just as long as more expensive brands!,5
Love,"We have had this device for.over a week now and we love it! We have been able to use apps that encourage my daughter with special needs development, watch movies on it and read books we don't already own through it! Both of my daughters love it... Maybe too much. I will say the interface is a little confusing to switch between the parent and the child profiles. This is not very intuitive as you have to go into the free time app to do so, but otherwise it's fairly easy to use once you understand it.",5
I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right,Batteries are decent. I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right.,3
Three Stars,Good price,3
One Star,Worst batteries ever....they work once and drain out...you try to use something again and the battery is dead!,1
decent batteries,decent batteries. ok life.,3
Not what I was expecting.,I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.,3
great deal,great quality,5
Waist of Money. Awful product,Horrible. Amazon batteries are the WORST!! I have a battery operated little decorative light string. 2 Duracell batteries will light those things for weeks. 2 amazon batteries last about (and I'm not kidding) maybe 4 hours. Complete waist of money. Dollar store batteries are better. Do NOT purchase these,1
Three Stars,Cheap and convenient.,3
Value pack,"The picture looks like the batteries are white, but they're actually silver. Helps from confusing them with eneloops or other rechargeables.",5
Perfect for little kids,"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books.",5
Five Stars,much cheaper and just as good,5
Cheap and short-lived,I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.,1
I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services,"I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand.",1
Great Kids tablet,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.,5
it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price,"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly.",3
Don't last.,These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.,1
Why no Amazon statement regarding disintegrating cables,"Can someone explain to me why I can find hundreds and hundreds of people with this disintegrating isulation on charging cord problem, but not ONE post from Amazon with an official Company Statement about these defective, inferior, slave-labor built, imported, crap charging cablesAnyoneI'll be you dollars to donuts that these 100s of complains will bloom into 10s of thousands, as the existing, bad cables mature. (dry out, degrade, undergo radioactive decay, whatever their issue is). I'll bet I'll win!",1

One Star,Dangerous,1
Three Stars,fine,3
Excellent Product,"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!",5
Five Stars,Great product they last a long time!,5
These r the worst batteries ever,These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..,1

Three Stars,These batteries have a tendency to leak inside of devices and cause damage rendering them in operable,3
Batteries leak,"Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point.",1

I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again.",1
Five Stars,Works well,5
They do not last long,"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing.",3
excellent tablet,Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.,5
HOORAY FOR BATTERIES TO POWER THE UNIVERSE.....Too much,"These are batteries, what can you say about batteries. I mean they power stuff and were packaged like batteries are. I am impressed that Amazon has their own battery product. No complaints. Because they are batteries. Uhhhhh.........yeah.",5
Amazon Voyage dead trying to update software,"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",1
One Star,"Utterly worthless, no staying power.",1
wish they lasted longer,do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries,3
Terrible batteries! Not recommended!,Worst batteries I've ever used. I used them in a sensor light. They only worked l l/2 months while my prior Energizer batteries had worked for 5 l/2 months. I can see why these batteries are so cheap. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone.,1

So far so good,"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)",5
Five Stars,Yay batteries!,5
great deal!!,this work great so far! Such a great prices I was waiting for them to fail but so far they are working like powerful batteries should!,5
Five Stars,So far so good!,5
poor quality batteries,these are junk. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again.,1
Poor Performance Alkaline Batteries,"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!",1
dead,This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back,1
My granddaughter loves it!,She uses it every day. She can't get enough of it.,1

One Star,None of them would recharge.,1
Three Stars,Batteries don't last long at all.,3
"Good product, just not very convenient","Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place.",3
better than a nabi 2,my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.,5

Need guide/instructions,"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.",3
"Good price, do not last as long as higher price battereis.",Good price. Have used in my TV remote and had to change batteries after2 months. Other brand of batteries have lasted longer. Get what you pay for.,3
Paper white is the way to go,"This was advertised as the latest version 8. My ignorance led me to its 79 price. I thought they were all Paperwite - as in just like white paper in a book. Bought it for my wife. I returned mine as a refused shipment and ordered the PaperWhite. It has a backlight, higher resolution, and for 20, worth it. Kindler 1",3
These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice ...,"These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice any runtime difference between them and the other major brands. The price is awesome, and they work as expected. Nothing else to say about AA's really :)",5
so the family seems go through them like,"these batteries are ok but do not seem to have much power over time compared to the copper top brand. bought them for game controllers, so the family seems go through them like water",3
Bad experience with these batteries,Wrong item.,1
Great table for children,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.,3
Average battery life,I am disappointed in length of battery life.,3
I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.,1
Great Product,Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.,5
Amazon,Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games,3
Three Stars,its okay,3
PASS BY THESE,NOT MUCH POWER IN THESE BATTS,1

One Star,I feel like the batteries wasted quickly. It did not last as long as store bought batteries.,1
Five Stars,They work great,5
Wish it had more,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.,3
worthless!!,horrible --- they barely last a week in my tv remote control,1
Five Stars,"So far, they last as long or longer than the national brands.",5
Great value,"I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations.",5
AA rated,They are batteries...what can I say!,5
Awesome Kid's Tablet,Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!,5
Three Stars,Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(,3
Poor battery quality,"After receiving this box of batteries, as we made our way through them, we realized that the batteries were all close to dead. Now we are past the return date. Not buying these again. Would give zero star rating if I could.",1

Great tablet for child.,My daughter has had this tablet for almost 2 months and it works well.,3
my favorite kindle yet,love kindles and this one is the best one made by amazon. but expensive.,5
Five Stars,Super Price and they are fully charged. My end year date was 2026,5
Worst product,"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance",1
Quality Issues,"I purchased an 8-pack back in April. I used 2 right away in a remote and put the remaining 6 up in a cabinet. Last night (3 months later) I went to replace batteries in another remote and all 6 were dead. I purchased another box of batteries from a local store, installed them in the remote the remote worked great. Definitely a quality issue on some of these batteries based on other reviews.",1
Works great,"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking.",5
Tablet,My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present,5
Dont waste your money!,These batteries don't last!!!!,1
Works well but too tied to Amazon.,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.",3
Its a battery nothing much to say.,Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costco but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breaker this time.,3
You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at ...,"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries.",1
Amazon batteries,Batteries don't last very long compared to Duracell or Energizer,3
One Star,they are not good as described. the power is easy to be used out.,1
meh,"These do not last nearly as long as a name brand battery. So considering the cost/benefit, i'm not really sure if they are any better",3
DONT RECHARGE THEM,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them",3
Excellent price,My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.,5
Save your money,This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.,1
One Star,i like amazon product.but this battery was not good.,1
Just okay,Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.,3
One Star,Die way too fast,1
Great lasting batteries,These batteries have lasted just a long if not longer than the brand name.,5
Tablet gift,"I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost..",5
Cool little device,This is a neat little device and I love it. I am glad they added Audible functionality. It is a little pricey for an E-reader... actually very pricey but I got mine as a gift. I wish you didn't have to pay to have the ad's disabled though :(,3
Good Tablet for Toddlers to Teen,Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..,5

Beware: Exploding Batteries!!,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!",1
"Convenient, but shortlived","Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store",3
Somewhat disappointed...,"Lots of batteries, but I am going through them pretty quickly. I will switch to a higher quality battery on my next order.",3
Solid tablet,I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues,3

Good price.,Very good batteries.,5
Great for a kid,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!,3
Same as Duracell.,Same life as Duracell for a lot cheaper.,5
Not worth the price,Worst batteries I have ever purchased. I use in the mouse to my laptop. Doesn't hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage (maybe 4 hours/day). Not worth the price.,1
One Star,amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet,1
good for emails and social media,"I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes.",5
One Star,These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity.,1
What was Amazon Thinking,Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.,1
Great buy!,"It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating.",5
Not thrilled with these,"I'm not too thrilled with the life of these batteries. They don't seem to last as long as energizer does. And in some things, they aren't even strong enough to get rid of the 'dead battery' reading.",3

"Good value, does what you would expect","I hate running out of batteries so I bought this giant pack. It's a good value and the batteries seem to have plenty of juice for normal, non-hardcore activities (TV remotes, flashlights, that kind of thing). I haven't tried them in any high-power devices like digital cameras or remote control cars not sure if they would be the best choice in that case.Edit: they do not last as long as Duracells or Energizers",3
can't beat the price,"can't beat the price I bought this at from Best Buy. It has held up well inside the beefy case we bought for it, and the screen is nice and sharp.

Worse than the cheapest dollor store battery,Worst batteries ever. I bought these and put them in the drawer till needed. I have thrown out every single one trying to find 3 that work.,1

Best Battery for the,Love the price... now I never run out of batteries... and they last just a long as other batteries I have purchased.,5
Perfect for kids,"My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well",5
Decent game so far,I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.,3
Five Stars,Great for battery stock! They work as good as others.,5
Apps,Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device,3
Low Charge,I purchased these on 3/24/16 and last week I used a pair on a wireless keyboard. Within 1 hour my keyboard was blinking the low battery sign. I replaced the batteries with two new ones and the light blinked again within half an hour.My keyboard isn't the problem because I ended up using Eneloop AAA batteries and it worked fine the rest of the day.,3
Overall okay,"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store.",3
Great batteries at a great price,These batteries seem to be just as good as brand name batteries,5
Don't waste your money!,These are horrible! Don't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!,1
Three Stars,Was kind of disappointed they are made in China when US-sourced batteries are readily available.,3
BUYER BEWARE!!,Terrible batteries!! They exploded all over my face. Received them on a Monday and that Sunday was having problems with my remote so I opened it up and was sprayed in the face with acid. Luckily it missed my eye.

Great for the kids... no Google Play Store,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",3
Amazon,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.,3
Frustration filled packaging.,"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen.",1
Not the greatest for kids,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.",1
I love these for the price I haven't noticed any difference ...,I love these for the price I haven't noticed any difference between these and the major brands. but they are definitely better than Kodak and store brands I have tried.,5
Worst batteries ever,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.,1
Won't order again.,I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.,1
Device is not as rugged as it could be returning,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.,3
wish they lasted longer,do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries,3
Unable to use it,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.,1

Real bummer.",1

Awesome tablet,I absolutely love my new kindle tablet!! I love the size and feel of it. It has auto blue shade. I can set it for what time I want it to dim.,5
Charging Port Does Not Last - Not good for kids!,I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.,1
Hard to open!,They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.,3
Probably wont buy again,"When I opened the pack and put them in a device, it already said battery low.",3
"Good, but not great",I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.,3
Three Stars,"These batteries don't seem to last as long as others. I would not call them performance, just cheap.",3
Great for kids,We bought this for our two year old grandchild he loves it we set up a screen name for him and he plays on it every night! He has dropped it several times and it's fine nothing at all wrong with it!! Very durable!,5
Cheap batteries,Well this is my second order of batteries thru Amazon and both the energizer and these are not as good as the ones from the store,3
love it!,fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!,5
Good deal,Batteries seem like any other they work and seem to last,3
Perfect for the reader,Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.,5
Sturdy Tablet,"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.",3
Didn't Last As Expected,"I used these in wireless microphones in church. They didn't last as long as I expected. Actually, rechargeable batteries do nearly as well.",3
worst batteries ever,"I don't even want to give this a star, worst batteries ever, lasted 15 minutes top. Do not buy",1
Five Stars,"Cheap, Durable, Batteries. Unless it's a battery emergency, I wont buy from any other place but amazon",5
One Star,"These are absolute junk. I'm half way through the pack and so far every single battery has leaked.UPDATE:Ok, these batteries are horrible. Every single battery leaked, ruining some of the items they were in. In almost 30 years of buying from Amazon these batteries are the most disappointing thing thing I've ever received.Amazon, in case you are interested the lot number is JK150601",1
They are okay. I thought by the reviews they ...,They are okay. I thought by the reviews they would last longer but I'm only getting a little life out of them.,3
Very competitive,"Very competitive product at good price. I originally rated this le, but learned I had. made a mistake in my install.",5
Waste of money...Short lifespan,"These are awful. So far I've used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I've also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Waste of money.",1
Size and price good.,Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.,3
Three Stars,I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.,3
Awesome tablet,Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.,5
did not need,I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didnt so it was a waste of money. I do so hate to waste money. the Kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charger and it comes with a cable that connects to the computer. For some reason I thought I just had to have this too when I bought my Kindle.,1
Still figuring it out,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could.",3
NEVER AGAIN,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far.",1
Shoddy Asia Product,"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with.",1
"First, trial and evaluation","The price is very acceptable, however, feed backs on file indicate these may be a trade-off for shorter life usage. One review stated having experienced battery content leakage. In any event evaluations must be based on individual usage over a reasonable length of time, so I'll reserve my decision on re-orders after first order usage",3
Great tablet for my 11year old.,Strong amount of features and very fast. Easy to use tablet that my daughter is really enjoying.,5
Great!,I bought this for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He loves it!,5
Poor quality stop holding charge after ten cycles.,"Your milage may vary. My milage is after being recharged less than ten times, two different sets of the batteries rapidly lost capacity to hold charge (from full to empty in 30 seconds) and leaked, each time in a different devices, damaging at least one of them.. I'm hesitant to try any more of them.My opinion garbage.I have been using rechargeable batteries for years. Frys' no name, Energizer and Duracell all worked great. The AmazonBasics are no where near the level of the these brands in regards to quality.",1
Perfect Kids Tablet,"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy.",5
Three Stars,they work but I wish they were USA made,3
Hard to get used to-love the auto light,Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly,3
Performance is right!,Excellent batteries! Even better than some name-brand overpriced ones we've bought,5
Shortest lasting batteries I've ever used,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die.",1
Not for overseas!,"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!",1
An ok tablet,It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps,3
not bad,"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though",3
One Star,Horrible batteries. So far every battery we have used hasn't worked!!!,1
Not like other android tablets,This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.,1
Duds,All but about 4 were duds. What a waste of money.,1
Crashed after update,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed,1
It's a Hit!,Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!,5
One Star,They don't hold a charge very well.,1
They seem to not last as long as other brands. Great Price though,They seem to not last as long as other brands. Great Price though,3
Not worth the savings,"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)",3
just okay,do not seem to last as long as other batteries,3
great tablet,"Decent camera, clarity on the screen, fast downloads.",5
My daughter likes it,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids.",3
"Works great, cheap price",Cheap batteries and they work well. What more is there to say,5
For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not ...,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem,3
Not meet needs,Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.,1
Useless batteries,DO not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn't so apparently I'm just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!!,1
I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd ...,I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as tv remotes they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand.,1
Terrible inferior batteries,"I tried using these on my mini mist diffuser, amazon basics batteries discharges easily within a week. This is terrible in comparison to energizer batteries which lasts at least 3 months.",1
My granddaughter is happy with her Fire HD8,I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.,5
I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries ...,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work.",1
Fair,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.,3
Great product!!!,Great price!!!,5
Three Stars,i meant to order AA and not AAA.I shall reorder,3
haven't had good luck with these as they seem to run down too quickly,Don't know if it's my camera or the batteries but they seem to run down pretty quickly,3

Enough said,Their batteries,3
Five Stars,Inexpensive and work great!,5
"They are cheaper, they do work, but not for as long.",Ours did not last nearly as long as energizer or Duracell in our sons toys. No real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restocked with energizer.,3
Buyer Beware!,"Bad investment. Some of the batteries did not even work - no juice in them. Really surprised by the poor quality, Amazon Basics.",1
AAA batteries.,These don't last long at all.,1
Five Stars,great price,5

One Star,They lost power within minutes in digital cameras.,1
Do not buy!,"Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 docket charger. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaked battery acid all over my charger and ruined one docket, and ruined an under cabinet puck light. Save your money! They won't last!",1
Not for computer beginner,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.,3
i have allways been impressed with Amazon brand products.,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed,1

too many bells and whistles,"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet",3
Five Stars,Performed like about any other name branded AA Alkaline battery,5
Excellent product at a very reasonable price.,This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.,5
Book reader,"Gift for my wife, she loves it. Reads on it all the time.",5
Great for kids,I got this for a friends son the only problem with it is he won't put it down LOL,5
They were better before they were performance batteries,"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning.",3
These are OK for the price. I have an ...,These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.,3

Battery acid leaking out of a few batteries,Everything was fine except a few of the batteries brand new out of the pack I purchased a couple weeks prior were corroded with battery acid seeping out.,3
Batteries were duds,None of first eight batteries I opened worked. Tested other batteries to confirm was a battery problem. Confirmed!!!Wow.,1
Must Have for Avid Readers,So many improvements over previous models. Love the new page turn feature.,5
Christmas Gift,I bought it for my fianc√© and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.,5
Three Stars,Lots of batteries. Not a lot of battery life.,3
DO NOT BUY,You get what you pay for.Lucky to get 2 weeks of minimum use.,1
Main pocket does not open wide as I would like,"This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone.",3
Nice Basic tablet,"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.",3
Poor quality.,"Multiple batteries leaked, ruining one toy and causing messes in other items. Poor quality.",1

Great tablet,"Bought it as a gift, the wife loves it more than her iPad",5
Excellent tablet forever,I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good,5
easy use for a 4 year old,I observe my 4 year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease. She is able to play some of the games and upload movies. Her mom had to put a secret password for the movies because she downloaded some that you had to pay for!,5

These are cheap and seem to last as long as ...,These are cheap and seem to last as long as any other battery I've tried. I'm seriously impressed with the amount of batteries I get. For the same price I could get 16 of my usual brand. This will be my go-to from now on.,5
Do yourself a favor and save some money.,"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered.",5
Love this tablet,Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.,5
Not looking too good...,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.,3

Great for the price.,Plenty of power for your average household ham and egger.,5
surprising,"Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable",5
Shortest battery life ever experienced,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one.",1
These don't last very long...,"...not even in a mouse, where I've already had to replace the batteries in less than three months, where premium brand batteries last the best part of a year or more.I thought these would be a bargain given the price. But the life is so short there is no benefit or savings. I won't buy these again.",3
Amazon came through,"good price, worked fine",5
An OK tablet,"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80",3

One Star,More than half did not work,1
Meh,"Great price but they don't hold their charge for long. I find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year. At this price, it's not so bad but it's much more frequently that I'm used to.",1
Outstanding,Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.,5
Die in about a week,"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand.",1

nice in a price,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.,3
Good product but hard to setup for Grandson,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products",3
Discharges Very Fast,Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn't expect amazon product to be of such poor quality.,1
AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries are AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries. WOW!,These AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries are actually AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries and work as such. Unbelievable.,5
Great tablet!,I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.,5
Not cool Amazon.,These batteries leaked into my mouse and killed it. Not cool Amazon.,1

Good AAA bateries,I like the amazon batteries and they have different sizes and quantities to order. I'm satisfied with the length of time they last and the price is OK also.,5
Just a Bit Too Short,These batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every AAA device. Beware.,3
Great Product,So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!,5
Chronic issue with charging port,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",1
Christmas gifts,I‚Äôve used one on multiple occasions. They seem to user friendly so I bought 3 of them for Christmas gifts for my nieces and son.,3

Great updated Kindle,"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages.",5
Nice,"Love these batteries, would buy again!",5
Great beginner tablet.,"I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money.",5

Good stuff,"Lots of batteries, cheap price. Work great.",5
Short lived in Firestick remote. Wondering if I have a bad batch of AAAs.,In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degrade quickly in remotes. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention.,1
Okay but good for the price.,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.,3
One Star,Don't waste your money. They last about 2 days in a wii remote.,1
Love my Fire 8 Tablet!,I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use,5
Three Stars,doesn't last very long,3
It's ok,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.,3
Wish it had more,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.,3
The definitive Kindle.,"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",5
Great little online browser for the price,I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.,5
One Star,Inconsistent. VERY short life.,1
Awesome batteries for the price,"Love love these batteries, great value",5
Gret device,"This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc.",5
Terrible,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..,1
kindle kids fire,it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad,3
One Star,Just what I needed - thank you,1
Good as the Name Brand,nothing but good luck with the Amazon Basics Alkalines.,5
Don't Buy,"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results.",1
Amazon Fire 7 Tablet,Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.,1
Tablet not for kids,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...,3
Great Door Prize,Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it.,5
Perfect gift for any age!,My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!,5
"Good hardware, bad software","The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...",3
C...R....A...P!!!,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!,1
"OK, good price",They work,3
Awesome tablet,This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!,5
You might just get what you pay for...,"The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something.",3
A mediocre tablet,"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive.",3
Batteries popped and got acid all over.,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.,1
Costco's are better,Do not last as long as costco/kirkland equivalents.,3
One Star,do not last long at all - never by these again,1
Not sold on these yet.,Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.,3
Slow! Don't waste you money!,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.",1
Hard to set up,I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help,3
Grandkids first tablet.,"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe.",5
Good price,Great price. Too soon to tell if it is a great value.,3
One Star,Batteries must be old don't work!,1
Three Stars,Good competition for the big boys.,3
I Won't Reorder,"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable.",1
Three Stars,Don't last very long.,3
Great & Easy to Use.,"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games.",5
Great for the kids... no Google Play Store,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",3
Garbage,"Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!",1
Five Stars,no complaints,5
BUYERS BEWARE- high ratings not what it seems.,"From experience, the worst batteries I've ever purchased. Not sure if these were manufactured second hand but more than half of the pack died within ONE USE. As a new mom who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child's needs, I will never order this product ever again.",1
Beware! These leak!,"Sorry to say these batteries leaked in a lighted mirror and ruined it. C'mon, Amazon!",1
Three Stars,Brand names are better. These were not very long lasting. You get what you pay for.,3
OK for general uses..,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK.",3
Great tablet for a child/early teenager,"We have always been Nexus Tablet desciples, and in fact have bought 6-8 of them for self and family members. This one was for granddaughter to replace Nexus that had gotten slow.This one works better/faster than the Nexus! It's fast....easy to use; perfect tablet for a child or teenager...and can't beat the price!Very pleased with purchase....",5
Good Cheap Tablet,"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all",5
Easy setup,My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.,3
The lighting is great,I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.,5
Short Battery Life!,"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired.",1
I needed batteries for my kittens toys. The first ...,"I needed batteries for my kittens toys. The first three I used lasted only 5 hours!! I am so unhappy, I spent 8 which is a lot of money for me.",1

The future is amazing!,Powers what I want. The future is amazing!,5
Good for its money.,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.,3
Five Stars,arrived on time just as described,5
Bad batteries with very short life!,These are bad batteries with very short life. I returned my first order assuming that I got a bad batch (despite the expiration date years away). Started using the replacement order in late May and already have to replace the batteries.I love Amazon Basics products and Amazon service but this product is a big dud. This is the first negative review I've ever written about a product on Amazon.,1
Stay away,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it,1
Three Stars,Batteries don't last very long,3
nice in a price,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.,3
Five Stars,Have had no trouble.,5
Great tablet for the price.,"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled.",5
Really disappointed in how long they last,These last about 5 hrs in a roku remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last.,1
Better than before,"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse.",3
Life short,"Yes life short, that's right",3
Easy to use,its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it,5
Five Stars,Better than name brands,5
Five Stars,Best batteries for best price!,5
great tablet,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids,5
Total junk,Junk - after trying 10 batteries one worked!,1
Not bad,"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this.",3
Best gift for the wife ever.,My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.,5
Kindle fire hd,"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money.",5
Not really statisfied with features,Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it,1
No power,Batteries died after a week. Same appliance used Duracell batteries for half a year.,1
Super short life.,"We bought these batteries to use in a medical Holter Monitor. Typically we put batteries in for 24 or 48 hour monitors. After one use, we need to replace the batteries. These batteries did not even last the 24 hours. Patients wasted their time and the testing was wasted. It was embarrassing to make the patient reschedule their test due to our equipment failure. These cost our business money. Will never buy again.",1
wonderful,"I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it",5
Great batteries,"Great batteries, nice to have and good price.",5
Three Stars,"these are not comparable to Duracell, but it's cheap",3
... as long in some devices as other brands but good for the cost,Doesn't seem to last as long in some devices as other brands but good for the cost.,3
bang for the buck,for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!,3
Good batteries for toddler toys!,"These batteries work great but they don't last as long as name brand batteries but that's ok. We mostly bought them for my toddler's toys and they work well enough for that!-As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review. Thank you!",3
I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference ...,"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.",1
love it works great,"battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint.",5
Not so good!,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!,1
Kids love it,"Purchased for my daughters to use, and they love it, user. Interface is easy to use, love the fact that I can select what is available to them.",5
They sure are batteries...,"They're batteries and they come charged and ready to go, there is not much of a review you can write about batteries. They power my daughter's choo choo train set, so I'm content.",5
Great tablet,This tablet is great and easy to use. Very convenient and handy to have around,5
"Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8"" - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - T","A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why.",3
Good price,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality,3
Great tablet,This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase,5
Great battery,"Amazon Basics has a quality battery supply, not just in A4A size. These batteries lasted as long as I would expect the Costco brand and Duracells I also have in my possession to last.I love Amazon Basic for quality and cost-savings on a variety of products!!I just ordered the 12-pack of Amazon Basic RECHARGEABLE AAA ones tonight since the disposables stood their ground as a great battery!!!",5
Five Stars,Performed as expected and at a good price.,5
So far so good. The batteries are working great,So far so good. The batteries are working great. I do like how they are packaged in groups of 4 inside a box. It keeps them in order once you remove a bundle or two.,5
Total waste of money,Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.,1
Three Stars,Seems like it doesn't last as long as other battery brands.,3
Nice portable speaker,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,3
Rarely gives a good answer,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,3
Still up in the air,"Resolution was great, speed was good. Bought for grandson, he didn't like it because it would not run Google apps and couldn't watch u-tube without purchasing additional apps.",3
The tablet I bought was a 3th birthday gift..,Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....,1
Three Stars,Haven't use the batteries at this time and expect 5 star performance.,3
EXCELLENT,"Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2",5
"Good but there are cheaper, high quality batteries available","I have not had them long but they seem to be doing the job that is required. I will check back in later to discuss battery life if I remember. I will say, that I could have found batteries a bit cheaper around town and on the internet so I probably will not buy these again for this reason.",3
Works well but too tied to Amazon.,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.",3
Three Stars,It's a battery...,3
They were better before they were performance batteries,"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning.",3
Disappointed,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor,1
Fair,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.,3
Dead batteries,None of these batteries had a full charge. My charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. This was true for the other two sizes D and AAA.,1
One Star,The package was open and missing two batteries.,1
Five Stars,Cheap and fine.,5
"A great deal, and the batteries have a good life ...","A great deal, and the batteries have a good life to them. I will buy again when I start running low.",5
Internet connection shotty,I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!,3
Not meet needs,Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.,1
Great tablet for speed,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,3
Three Stars,They don't last long.,3
Awful lifespan,"I've been using these on my roku remote and the lifespan is terrible. About two weeks, when Duracell's have been 1-2 months",1
Good buy,these batteries work just fine and reasonably priced,5
they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are ...,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality.",3
These batteries last about 25 of a stander energizer! ...,These batteries last about 25 of a stander energizer! Dont be suckered in by the price..... WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!,1
So So performance,Good price for batteries except it seems like they don't last near as long as name brand,3
Bad experience with these batteries,Wrong item.,1
One Star,More then half did not work :(,1
Awesome,"Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids.",5
Perfect no. of compartments,"Pros- Feels Light weight even when stuffed fully. Perfect no. of compartments.Cons - Poor zipper quality, side ouch for water container is small.",3
I‚Äôve read more this week than ever before,"I bought my Kindle because I heard it was good for reading in direct sunlight. I‚Äôve got a bay window I like to read at and other tablets I‚Äôve read on produce a lot of glare. This has zero glare and I can‚Äôt wait to take it camping this Spring/Summer/Fall. A side note, this is way lighter than any book (as you may have guessed). I like to read on my back and having this has drastically increased the amount of time I can read for.",5
Did not work properly.,It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.,1
Waste of money,These batteries DO NOT last. They are a waste of money.,1
Very good value and price,Very good value and price! I could get batteries at the store for maybe 10pk or 20pk for 16.99-32.99 I rather buy all my batteries here!!!,5
Great for my daughter,My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles,5
Good but SLOW,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine.",3
5 stars!!!,"AmazonBasics AA batteries save me a lot of time and money going to the store and buying them pack by pack, it is very cost efficient to but these for my budget friendly family of 5.I love that this is a big pack of batteries, 20 in all making the price drop down to about .38 cents a battery. I use these in everyday things from remotes, to flash lights. They work just as good as the more expensive batteries saving me lots of cash.I turn to the AmazonBasics brand when it comes to all of my office needs. I can't complain about any of their products I bought so far. Now it's time to buy a big pack of AAA batteries from AmazonBasics. I highly recommend these batteries to anyone out there looking to buy a great quality pack of batteries. These are great for products that have a highly running life like babies products or toys. They defiantly can keep up with my family without wasting ton of money.",5
Bought two of these.,Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps.,5
Very satisfied,Great deal. Very satisfied with value and performance. Seem to last as long as anything else.,5

Awesome!,Boom-Shacka-Lacka-Lacka! Great price!,5
No power.. no charge,"I like amazon products. But these haven't worked in any thing I've put them in. Nerf gun, toys.. nothing. Maybe they work in remotes.....",1
not at all powerful,These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name.,1
Voice command only would be nice.,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",3
Three Stars,They last less than your average alkaline batteries.,3
Three Stars,They have a short shelf life,3
You get what you pay for,"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer.",3
Five Stars,Great quality batteries. Highly recommended and will continue to buy. Really good price too!,5
Fair Batteries,"These are fair batteries. They are fine for most toys, etc. but they don't seem to last as long as Duracell or Energizer batteries. And I've found some of the packs to be hit or miss. I've had a few packs with several of the batteries already nearly drained straight out of the package.",3
Five Stars,very good itemfast shipmenthigh quality,5
Beware: Exploding Batteries!!,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!",1
Great for kids,Awesome tablet. I was amazed how fast it is. And the software is very user friendly,5
Fantastic Value,"This little tablet was purchased during a moment of weakness. I really wanted a Kindle reader. But this has exceeded my needs for a fraction of the price. I can read and listen to books PLUS a ton of other things (including browse on wifi). The ""offers"" show as lock screens and notifications and can be ignored or dismissed easily and make the device price of under $50 (during a promo) very reasonable! Speed is decent, storage upgradable with MicroSD, and feels like a book in a folio-style case. PERFECT! Note: I have other higher-end productivity tablet devices, also. This WILL NOT replace them or do all they can do. Entertainment, internet browsing and leisure is what this was purchased for and I'm pleased.",5
Great tablet,"My son is fascinated with this tablet, and iam too.",5
Great for kids,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.,3
Stick with name brands,"Bought AmazonBasics for all the new toys my kids were getting for Christmas, all of which have had to be replaced in the past couple months. Life of this battery isn't great.",3

OK,"Love the price but for me,they just don't seem to last as long as my other brand.",3
Three Stars,Don't last as long as Duracells.,3
A disappointment...,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.,3
I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors ...,"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss.",1
Horrible,So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions,1
Reliable product,"This was a nice purchase for my son 8yr old, it performs well",3
The batteries had very short life,"The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it's November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short.",1
Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as ...,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.,1
No battery life,"Batteries do not last! Don't waste your money on these. I've been using them in a weight scale where 4 batteries would last 4-6 months. With these batteries, I only get 10 days of usage. No battery life.",1
Pay more for batteries that'll actually last!,"Now I know why these are so inexpensive! I'm baffled as to how they've earned such high reviews. I've used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispenser, in tap lights in a closet/hallway, in toys... In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. What a wasteful, useless product!",1
love to read and get free books,I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.,5
Great tablet,I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.,5
Good but has kinks,I bought 2 for my kids and got a great discount but the one my daughter uses has gave us a little trouble from the start,3
I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I'm finding I need to throw most of ...,Out of every package so far only 2 batteries are working. I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I'm finding I need to throw most of them away. I wish I could still return them.,1
Disappointed,"Worked for one day, then stopped working. Can't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend.",1
Excellent ... will buy again,Excellent for the price. I usually buy Duracell for the guys and their video game controllers -- these last just as long and saved us some .. came in a box that was great for storage and batteries were also vacuum packed by 4's inside the cardboard box. Will buy again,5
I do not recommend,I DO NOT recommend purchasing these batteries they barely last 24 hrs in what lasts 2 weeks with Costco or Duracell or Energizer brands.,1
Limited but Good,"I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it.",5
"Great tablet, just not for my daughter","Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies.",3
Never buy again,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATTERIES IVE EVER USED AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THEM,1
Disappointed,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor,1
A cheap tablet,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.,3
One Star,The capacity is suspect. I seem to have gotten a lot more out of Energizer.,1
Junk batteries,"Batteries used in fire remote, lasted maybe a week and then died",1
Excellent Value!,These work perfectly in every application I've needed them for. They have so far lasted just as long as the copper tops I usually buy at a significant price savings.,5
One Star,they let for about 5 recharges,1
Significantly improved,"This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker.",5
Crashed after update,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed,1
Okay For The Price.,They seem to die pretty fast.,3
Mother's Day Gift,I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.,5
Don't last very long,"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock.",3
Awesome!,My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.,5
Excellent Tablet for Kids,My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.,5
Five Stars,great price,5
Three Stars,we'll see how they hold up,3
"Stay Far, Far Away from these batteries","These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt.",1
Waste of money,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.,1
One Star,No good...worthless. I have no use for them.,1
Good for 4 year old,This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.,3
One Star,very cheap batteries,1
Bad product,"Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services.",1
One Star,This is not what I received.,1
Performance ones also,These are different than the ones pictured. Are these performance ones also,3
Haven't used them yet.,Thanks.,5
Don't use for critical devices!,"I bought these batteries to charge my insulin pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variables, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won't use these again.",1
Can't beat the price.,"This tablet is great if you have Amazon Prime. You really cant beat it for the price. I also have the 7"" version.",5
Crashed after update,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed,1
Excellent Tablet,"This tablet is exactly what Amazon was describing. It is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.The start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. For 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.",5
Not bad,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.,3
Could be a great tablet,The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.,3
Five Stars,"great price, I trust they will last longer than most too",5
Great for children,Good sales person helped review benefits for this product. It was a gift for our young grandchild. A few brands and sizes to select from...sales associate ease the decision.,5
Waste of money. Waste of time.,"I just open several new, cello packs to use in a motorized window shade cartridge. Loaded them up, plugged the cartridge in - nothing. Took the batteries out and checked each one in a battery tester. 3 of the 12 batteries were good. I opened up several more new packages and tested them before loading them into the cartridge. One out of every five had a charge, and the ones that had a charge were not strong charges. The rest are going to battery recycling. When it comes to batteries, you get what you pay for.",1
Batteries are great..,Batteries are great.....I need them for my work for my camera for taking pictures on the job of properties. Nice to have extras on hand at an affordable price. I don't see that they last any less time than the name brand batteries.,3
Very poor.,Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...,1
great beginners kids tablet,"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful",3
Durable,This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews.,5
"Great tablet, just not for my daughter","Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies.",3
Kindle fire 8 HD,Good for beginners. Although you need to have a google account and a credit card to start up. For reading purposes only.,3
Not enough storage,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working.",3
"Great protection, decent performance",I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.,3
One Star,life of the batteries do not last,1
No charge ..dead batteries.,Dead on arrival...please stay away.,1
Three Stars,"battery drains out fast, unlike duracell",3
An OK tablet,"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80",3
Three Stars,OK for AAA needs,3
This is a excellent e-reader,This is the best e-reader around tried all the other models and this by far is the best...,5
Batteries die very fast,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.,1
Five Stars,Whopping deal on AA battery's.,5
A little hard to teach it,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,",3
Easy to read in outdoor settings.,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,3
One Star,Terrible battery life!!!!,1
Good for young kids,Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast,3
Great speed no lagging,I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.,5
One Star,LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS,1
Save your money,This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.,1
no good,"In a box of 12 batteries, 4 worked for 2 months, 8 did not work at all, Total waste of money",1
One Star,These do not last long. Will never buy again,1
Five Stars,Good inexpensive batteries,5
One Star,Don't last!,1
Not living up to my expectation,I found this devices battery very poor and also didn't like this device can't support screen share capabilities with my Amazon Fire TV or Smart TV's.,1
Batteries Expanded inside two different wireless keyboards and ruined them.,"I have two Macs, each with their own wireless mac keyboards. I used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days. My desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined.",1
Not for computer beginner,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.,3
Good Buy for Kids,Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature,5
Worth the price,Great durability and long lasting at portion of price,3
Three Stars,They work a bit better compared to big chain generic batteries,3
Perfect!,Great batteries at a great price. No complaints at all.,5
Don't last as long as they should.,"These have failed after a few weeks each time I've used them in my wireless keyboard. Duracells, on the other hand, have lasted for months.",1
"As expected from Amazon, there were no problems with ...","As expected from Amazon, there were no problems with the ordering and delivery process. So far I have installed several batteries, but it's too soon to tell how long they are going to last.",3
Not too kid friendly,Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.,3
"Nice To Look At, But May Not Last Very Long","Bought these on Amazon for a good price, but they just don't seem to last very long. The packaging and batteries look nice. None of them leaked, but that could be because I went through them so fast.",3
Three Stars,They didnt last as long as duracells,3
Five Stars,Good and cheap.,5
Five Stars,Good long lasting batteries. I used AA for gaming so I go through alot,5
Ok for what you pay,Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do,3
Device failed after two uses,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",1
Great for a Beginner,"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!",3
Worth the,"Don't last long in my remote or the bathroom toilet light, which rarely comes on but is used every night.But then again, ALL batteries don't seem to last as long as they used to. So comparatively to Duracel, they're worth the .",3
Great price it was worth trying the cheapies,Can't beat the price. How long these batteries last or how effective they are still remains to be seen.,5
Very good tablet for kids,Very good first tablet for kids without breaking the bank. Have had no issues and the kids love them (ages 3 and 5),5
"Great for some applications, but not the longest lasting","Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices.",3
Grandson Loves it!!!!,"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,",5
Lack power for some applications,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal.",1
Burned by fire,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad.",3
Three Stars,don't seem to last as long as other brands.,3
Five Stars,Amazon batteries are always a GREAT deal!,5
Battery sucks,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.,3
Excellent would purchase again,Great value product!,5
Kindles rock,My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.,5
DID NOT receive the AA BATTERIES honest to god!!! :( which sucks bc I need them and my AAA batteries,DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!,1
Three Stars,They don't have as much juice as other name brand batteries but they will get the job done.,3
One Star,a few in the lot didn't work at all.,1
Five Stars,Been very happy with these batteries. Will order again!,5
These batteries leak acid!,"Please be aware that these batteries leak! I put these in a few electric candles and alarm clocks in our house, after a few days the bottom of the candles and clocks were coated with battery acid. No other battery brands have done this in our house before. I cannot tell you if they last long or not, got rid of them immediately.",1
One Star,doesn't last like the other brands,1
Easy to learn to use its many features.,"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets.",5
One Star,Booooo,1
It's pretty average for what you are paying,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.",3
The best gift ever,My grandkids love Thur tablets they are a very sturdy educational tool to have they keep them very calm and it's less fighting I have blue for the boys and pink for the girls they are absolutely the best and the price was awsome ....Thanks Best buy,5
Seems like quality varies,Seems like quality varies. Some of the batts work great and las long and in the same device some fail quickly,3
They're AAA batteries,They're AAA batteries,3
Three Stars,don't last as long as the brand name,3
Kids Tablet,It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.,3
Great Tablet,"I got this tablet to replace my sons old one, I love the adult/child profile and the ability to have the 2 year replacement warranty. The case has also came in handy many times.",5
Reading lover,My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!,5
Five Stars,Great price!,5
Met all my expectations,"Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!",5
Put these into a high power flashlight and took my ...,Put these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out. Within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless. I would never buy these again!,1
Leaking after 2 weeks...,"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries.",1
Very versatile,"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books.",5
Just plainly buy these!,Compared to other AA Battery types these take the cake! I just LOVE these AmazonBasics Batteries.,5
More work than it's worth,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get.",1
Worth the Premium Price,"I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White.",5
Will buy more,Good batteries. Great price!,5
awesome tablet.,My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...,5
it's ok,my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.,3
Great,This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.,5
Wait till it goes on sale.,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.,3
Great value,Great value and exceptionally long lasting.,5
Good tablet for kids,"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books.",3
They don't work. Still to regular brands.,They don't work. Still to regular brands.,1
Need full strength batteries Look elsewhere!,I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries,1
Five Stars,great Product,5
Good tablet!,"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall.",5
Good warranty and protection,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.,3
Would not work properly!,Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.,1
Ok,How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!,3
Nice tablet,My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!,5
One Star,These die way too fast.,1
One Star,Batteries did not last more than two days,1
Good reading device,"It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level.",5
Three Stars,Bargin.,3
Excellent price,My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present,5
Works great when they work.......,"Update 6/16/17: Purchased product again and they are working in the devices that they did not work in prior. Also, I believe the batteries are lasting longer than the batteries I purchased prior (maybe fresher... )When they work, they work great. I have a number of 'devices' that for whatever reason, they do not power up with these batteries. I can replace with a non AmazonBasics battery and it starts working. I do not see any difference in length, circumference,etc so not sure what is going on. With that said, they work great in this devices where there is not a compatibility problem.",3
Good tablet 4 kids,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,3
Dead on Arrival,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window.",1
Super Laptop Bag,"This bag is really great value for money, giving you everything you could want for carrying your laptop and accessories.",5
So so,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.,3
Confusing for me; returning,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",3
Great investment,I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.,5
Horrible Battery Life,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,1
we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. ...,we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours.,1

Five Stars,Great deal!,5
"Work just as good, if not better than other popular brands.","I'm really happy with these, they really surprised me. They're head to head with top brands eg. Energizer, Duralast, Raovac. I'm definitely going to buy my batteries from here now, they're such a good deal for such great performing batteries :)",5
DON'T BUY SIMPLE .....,"Never put a review online about a purchase , but this Amazon battery leak so badly I have to discard all of them after 2 weeks of use, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM ....",1
It fits my need perfectly,"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective.",5
Perfect for the price,"Always great to get AA batteries in bulk. Everything uses these things, we have like 20 remotes that are constantly chewing up batteries as well as flashlights and small candles. These work great and came at a great price. What more could you ask for",5
The other three in the pack was fine.,One of the batteries was dead right out of the package. The other three in the pack was fine.,3

No power,"Good price.... but (update 12/21/2016)Update - horrible batteries. Have gone through 8 out of 48 batteries and none have worked. Contacted Amazon, they state they will refund my money and apologized. Great customer service,but horrible product.Be aware of the refund/return policy with Amazon. Batteries are something I don't test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 AA's in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Tried 2 more.... nothing. Tried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what)... nothing again. Tried it my TV remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage.While the product gets 1 star (that's too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars.",1
Great product at a great price!,This was a gift for my granddaughter and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps her occupied for hours. It is also kid-proof!,5
less cumbersome,This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better,5
Love em,I bought these for my kids they really love them I love the fact that I can change parental settings in their learning time and the kids really enjoy them,5
Great for kids,This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her.,3
Hate to POP up Add's,Why do I get so many POP Up Adds on this! Its a great product but it's always trying to sell me something!,3
Basically a big phone...without the phone,This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.,3
Definitely will buy again,Great deal!! Ive had no problems with these batteries.,5
Five Stars,These work as well as the name brand batteries but with the convenience of delivery!,5
3 year old granddaughter loves it!!! Easy for her,"Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter.",5
Kids 1st tablet approved,Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it,3
I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open ...,I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open a pack today and they did not work. Fresh out of the plastic wrap and everything:(.,1
Three Stars,as expected.,3
Favorite Kindle so far!,This is my favorite kindle so far. The size is perfect and the weight is minimal. I love the fact it is back lit and I don't need a book light.,5
My daughters christmas gift.,I never have any issues with this company or products!,5
No summary yet,This was purchased as a Christmas gift and I have not had any experience with it yet.,3
Breaking after 3 months,"I've had my Thea for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues. The problem is now it's breaking (after only three months) and I have no clue why. It won't charge anymore and it isn't vibrating on full power. I'm hoping that Nymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee. I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in.",3
Very disappointed,"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V",1
Good for its money.,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.,3
One Star,they are terrible,1
Don't last long - maybe the voltage is low or something,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.,1
Perfect tablet for grandchild,"Grandchild is exploring and learning so much, having fun",5
buy bulk,great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it,5
I do not like this tablet. Period.,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",1
You Get What You Pay For,These batteries are good for the remote or other things that arent using constant power. Ive burned through a lot of these quickly with electronics that require energy for extended use. The jurys still out on whether its better to buy a smaller pack of higher quality batteries or this pack theyre both basically the same price.,3
Nice product,Was a Christmas gift and I ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.,3
"Yes, i have batteries.","Best bang for buck on batteries, and always good to have a small stock of them on hand for whatever you might need.split this with my roommate, and so we now each have some AAA and we also split a pack of AA, great for the controllers that dont get used regularly, toys, remotes, whatever, if you plan ahead, it is worth it.",5
Processor is slow,"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version.",3
Three Stars,"Nothing special, just alkaline disposable AA batteries at fair price.",3
Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. ...,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.,1
Too difficult to figure out,I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn‚Äôt appreciate.,1
One Star,Batteries did not last more than two days,1
good,This team that ranks well for low energy,5
beware of size,Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product,3
Ok for what it is,"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable.",3
Worst product,"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance",1
Stay away,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it,1
Five Stars,Haven't had to use them yet but I am sure they will do the job!!!,5
One battery corroded and leaked,Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries corroded and leaked in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again.,1
piece of junk,"I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help.",1
Three Stars,These do not last very long at all.,3
Very nice tablett,I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.,5
These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell ...,These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.,1
Good for its money.,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.,3
Three Stars,I didn't feel like they lasted as long as other batteries,3
GREAT tablets for kids,I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.,5
Good inexpensive tablet,Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.,5
Good price. Average performance,These are a great price but they don't seem to last as long as you would expect. Also I have found some are already dead upon arrival.,3
Nice size to travel with.,Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........,3
Good for Reading,Purchased it for my daughter. She love this very much. It is really good.,5
"Convenient, but shortlived","Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store",3
Device is not as rugged as it could be returning,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.,3
Still prefer iPad or android tablet,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",3
Amazon Tripple-A is top-notch product,Perfectly sent perfectly usable,5
I love it!,I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.,5
Great for reading borrowed books.,I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.,5
Great Tablet!,This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.,5
Three Stars,I like how i got so many itd months later and i still got a pack left!!,3
Don't last long,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.,3
Nice Upgrade,"This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password.",5
Short life!!,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it.",1
My three year old loves it,"This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty.",5
"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as.... 26 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No","BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)",3
One Star,Die way too fast,1
Good value for money,Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.,3
light weight and large print,"The Kindle Voyage is light weight, slim. easy to use and so far has been a good product. The page turns very easily and the light works very well. The anti glare screen is the best!",5
Good product,Good deal on basic batteries. Needed several pairs for tv remotes and these worked perfectly!,5
Couldn't possibly hate it more.,"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.",1
AMAZON failed on these batteries!!!,WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. Mouse was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. My husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL.,1
they come shrink-wrapped in little 4-packs so it's obvious no matter what which ones are brand new and you can scatter them abou,"Not only are these the least expensive AA batteries I could find, they come shrink-wrapped in little 4-packs so it's obvious no matter what which ones are brand new and you can scatter them about the house like the battery fairy so there's always a fresh pack nearby.",5
"Size really does matter, but not to Altra.","I like these shoes but Altra needs to pay more attention to sizing. I normally wear US 7.5-8. The first pair of Superior 2.0s I ordered was size 8 and they were way too short. OK, I thought, they run short. I ordered a pair size 8.5 and they were just barely long enough.I ordered a second pair size 8.5 and they are visibly half an inch shorter than the first size 8.5 pair. That isn't running short, it's lack of quality control.I really like these shoes, so I am ordering size 9's. But I do not have any warm feelings about Altra.",3
Five Stars,No frills but just what I needed.,5
Could be a great tablet,The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.,3
Batteries,Didn't seem to last as long as the standard USA name brands,3
Easy enough for Grandpa,"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance.",5
Three Stars,Decent batteries but do not seem to last that long in electronics,3
"These batteries are terrible, do not buy, waste of money.","The batteries suck. I have them in my mouse and I have to replace them every week. My Duracell's would last a month. I feel like they are only 1/2 charged, I put new ones in my flash for my high quality camera, and the flash was really slow and dim. Pretty crappy for new batteries. I am not pleased",1
Dies quick!,run out super quick! would not buy again,1
One Star,"Really good price for a reason, first two batteries I used were dead. Do not waste your money!",1
They go dead really fast.,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.,1
Three Stars,Does not last long,3
Love touch screen technology.,"Great little lap top with touch screen, absolutely ruins you.",5
No good.,"Do not buy. Inconsistent quality, performance, some leak and ruin things.",1
Not too impressed,"Bought it for my 3 year old son. Physically the product is amazing! Love the case around it, and how amazon replaces the product if anything happens, no questions asked. However, the software is terrible. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but its hard to consider this as a tablet when everything is limited. I only use it now to play movies from an external SD card, which cannot be played via kids profile",3
Nothing special,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac.",1
"It worked 30 minutes, shut off and won‚Äôt start","It‚Äôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly",1
One Star,5 of the batteries leaked from the package. Will not buy these again.,1
Exceptional Tablet,The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!,5
Terrible,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,1
One Star,They do not last,1
It dies a lot quicker,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.",3
Three Stars,These don't work for any decent amount of time! Stick with the name brand,3
"Very sturdy, metal, uncomfortable.","If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend..",3
Five Stars,ok,5
Alkaline,Mediocre performance,3
These Batteries Last and Last,These batteries have been performing wonderfully in my clocks and other small appliances. The price is right with Subscribe and Save and I can't beat the quality or price elsewhere. They come nicely packed and shrink wrapped in four packs making them easy to carry. I will definitely continue to purchase.,5
Ok got the price average longevity. Think rechargeables next time,I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk. Worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables,3
Kindle Fire #2 for me,"I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels",3
"love this product, easy and fun for kids!","Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination",3
They're batteries,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know.",3
It's okay,volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.,3
Five Stars,just as adverised - fast shipping,5
Well Worth The Price,Great batteries at a great price! These really last a long time and are great for all the battery operated Christmas decorations.,5
if it doesn't need a 2A then it takes a 3A,once every other year and i never run out,5
Awesome,My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!,5
One Star,Entire pack of batteries was dead!,1
Disappointing!,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time.",1
Will buy again.,Fast delivery and great price.,5
Five Stars,Good price. Shipped fast.,3

good,everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...,5
"just what you need, when you need a simple reliable battery","Just like brand name, but cheap and convenient",5
Amazon Fire,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.,3
Don't last as long as a brand name battery,These are priced nice but don't last long,3
"If you are paying this price, go for Rayovac.","These are OK. Used to Rayovacs to save but, these cost the same and seem to last about 3/4 as much as the other brand. Mostly used for Xbox controllers and Mac mice/keyboard.",3
Great Tablet,Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints,5
horrible batteries,"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free.",1
Almost,"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.",3
A great little computer,"Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,",5
Good tablet,Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it,3
Horrible batteries,"Very unhappy with these batteries. Used them for my flame-less candles, 3 batteries in each. I use a remote to turn the candles on, so they were only on a few hours at a time AND only a few nights a week. Died in less than 3 WEEKS!",1
Best price for high quality batteries,"I like that these were wrapped in plastic in sets of 4 to help keep them organized. These worked well and restocked my battery storage area. The box was simple and compact, no larger than it had to be - this is never the case at big box stores. Thanks, Amazon!",5
No good.,Batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector. I will never buy this brand again.,1
Perfect for my uses and can't beat the price,"I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it.",5
good product for the money,Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.,3
Great for kids,Awesome device for my six year old. Very safe useage,5
Great Gift,"This is just what my father wanted. It is portable, light weight and has an amazing backlight.",5
You get what you pay for!,Not the best.,3
Did not work properly.,It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.,1
Great for the price!,Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.,5
Yuck- wrapped in the box!,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.",3
LEAK !,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again.",1
Just what i needed,Now my robot army will never run out of power again MUAHAHAHAHAHA!,5
"Low price,low quality!",Do not last as long as Copper Top!,3
Great for a Beginner,"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!",3
It's ok.,"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.",3

Dead in 1.5 days in Fire TV remote,"I got two of these batteries with my Fire TV stick. Loaded them in and everything was good for 1.5 days. Then the Fire TV stick stopped responding. I trouble shooted with no fix. Called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too, started by saying can you change the batteries.... my response ... seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it's a freaking TV stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device. So I was changing the batteries as I was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem. So.... these amazon batteries died in 1.5 days. How does that happen",1
Good tablet 4 kids,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,3
"Mom review, no techie stuff.","I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me.",3

Excellent,I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.,5
Doesn't hold charge long,After one use in a regular used battery powered item it's dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery.,1
Three Stars,Works for what we needed.,3
but you get a good amount in the box,"I use them for Xbox one controllers, 2 batteries last maybe 2 weeks in my controller, but you get a good amount in the box. Might just look into rechargeable batteries. Tv remotes last longer obviously. 48 batteries for 12 was an easy sell though for me",3

Stay Away - Leaking acid issues from multiple cells,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess.",1
Could have a longer battery life,"These batteries seem to not last as long as other batteries I have used. They feel like they're made of good material, but they don't last as long as I would like them to.",3
No good,I wanted solar batteries.,1
But good for the price,Not the longest lasting. But good for the price.,3
Five Stars,Good enough batteries,5
The tablet not so great as mentioned,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow",1
They are OK but not nearly as good as other batteries,"They are OK but not nearly as good as other batteries. They die far more quickly than other name brands. For example, I've changed the battery on my mouse three four times in just a few months already verses prior Durecell batteries that I changed maybe once a year. Several other things such as wireless Apple keyboard, remotes, etc., similar results, e.g., batteries wore out in a third or fourth of the time of Durecell. I won't buy them again. Discount not worth it. Result of purchase has been net negative.",3
Easy setup,My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.,3
Don't last long - maybe the voltage is low or something,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.,1
BAD Amazone product,These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work,1
My kids love these,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",3
My first tablet,"Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet.",3
Good,They work just like the ones you buy at Walmart.,5
Dont use for childrens toys,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.,1
it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price,"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly.",3

great for a kid that loves tech,Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.,5
They're not bad but...,"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but...",3
BEWARE OF LEAKING BATTERIES,Had these in my wii for 2 weeks and the batteries leaked all over.,1
Three Stars,Very weak batteries.,3
Solid tablet,I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues,3
Best Tablet,This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child,5
1/4 Capacity Batteries,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",1
the clocks started to work fine again. You get what you pay for,"These DO NOT WORK. I have tried them in 2-3 different clocks, and they are not working at all. When replaced with other batteries, the clocks started to work fine again.You get what you pay for...",1
great tablet,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids,5
Ok for a young person,"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :(",3

"Leaked, ruined toy.","Bought these March 2015. It's now Feb 2017 and my son said his toy lightsaber had just stopped working. Opened it up and batteries have leaked causing corrosion to contacts. No longer works, even with new batteries. It's not a very expensive toy, but the 1 most important aspect of a battery is that it not leak. What's the point of saving a few dollars on batteries if they are going to ruin something much more expensiveWith major brands, you can send in leaked batteries and device for repair or refund. Although I've never done thisThe version I bought were silver and green, so perhaps they have changed.Leaked batteries had 1.46,1.46,1.25v respectively.",1
Trying something new!,"We have had cell phone service tablets for years, our kids need kid tablets. We bought 2! So cute and a great price...",5
The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run ...,The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. A little disappointed.,3
Five Stars,Nice,5
... wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries,Just got them so i really wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries are,3
Excellent Tablet,The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.,5
Perfect for my 4 year old,Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.,5
"It's an ok tablet, but very limited in apps.",I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.,3
Good for little kids,Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho,3
Good battery! Good price!,These are perfect for the battery-hungry race cars and tracks we bought our grandson for Christmas! Great pricing as well.,5
short battery life,short battery life,1
Great Buy,"Batteries on point. Top tier, seem to perform at the same level or better than Duracell's. 48-pack for this price is hard to beat! You won't regret it.",5
Really wanted to love Amazon AA Batteries!,"I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours.",3
Best (AAA) Batteries for your Buck!,"I prefer purchasing my batteries in bulk, so that I can buy them once and forget about them for the upcoming months (or year). AmazonBasics was, at the time of purchase, the most economical pack of AAA batteries.I haven't noticed any difference in time or quality of use. I don't use AAA batteries for many things, though, and for those that I do the items tend to last for quite some time on a pair of batteries, so I would not notice a change unless the batteries were really, really poor quality. Thankfully, they're not, and their price point made them a steal for me. These also store well - I have had no issues using some of these that my parents purchased years ago and they appear comparable to the pack I purchased recently.I've lately been really impressed with the quality of electronics that AmazonBasics offers. As store-brands go, this is among the first that has yet to disappoint me!",5
tons of limitations,I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....,3
Defective! All Amazon batteries I tried over the past ...,"Defective! All Amazon batteries I tried over the past year have been defectlve. Most too short. I have to constantly pull the spring, if the device has the spring, and roll the battery around to get it to work again. These are new batteries. Many of the batteries were thrown away because we thought they had been used up. It wasn't until recently that we realized it was all the Amazon batteries that were causing the problem. I was on the phone with Amazon for two hours yesterday trying to get these orders straighten that out. I still have no confirmation that I do not have to send the batteries back because many went into the trash.",1
Long lasting good quality,These batteries last as long if not longer than the top name brand.,5
Excellent Tablet for a toddler,My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable.,5
Good budget tablet,"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space.",5
BATTERIES DIE EXTREMELY FAST!!,These do not last at all. I have a very mini desk fan that takes 4 AA and they need to be changed every other day.,1
Five Stars,Enjoy haveing plenty of good batteries here at home!,5
Great tablet for price,Bought it for a gift. I do not know what else to say!,5
love it,Always great to upgrade new from old version when the staff is always knowledgeable,5
Returned,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item.",1
Excellent tablet for kids,Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!,5
Three Stars,I think it was recargable,3
Best gift for Beginers,Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.,3
They are batteries. They are cheap. They work ...,"They are batteries. They are cheap. They work. That is all, goodnight.",5
Short life batteries,Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don't waste your money.,1
Confusing for me; returning,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",3
BEST VALUE! GREAT DEAL,Amazon never lets me down. These batteries are a great value. Cheaper than Sams club batteries and these are shipped to my house for free with Prime. They seem to last just as long as energizer batteries. They come packaged in a nice box and are wrapped in plastic. For all the toys we have that take batteries these are great.,5
Five Stars,Really good batteries.,5
They are good batteries for the price but I find I have ...,"They are good batteries for the price but I find I have to change the batteries in my kid's toys more often than I did with duracell. Because of the price I would still buy them again, but if it's something you don't want to be swapping the batteries on all the time, I would go for a different battery.",3
good for price,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.,3
Three Stars,They're batteries. They work.,3
Battery leaked 2 months later.,"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat.",1
Three Stars,Made in the USA would make this a 5 star,3
WORST ALKALINE BATTERIES EVER TRIED. SAVE YOUR,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline,1
EXPLODED....What a waste!!!,"Went cheap...got cheap. DO NOT BUY. Went to pack for an upcoming trip and noticed brown stuff all over. I was storing the batteries in a separate case (which is now ruined). Thank goodness this wasn't in any if my expensive scuba or camera equipment. Never had other brands do this. Always store batteries outside of equipment anyways. Totally bummed. Shame on you Amazon. Get out of the battery business. I buy A LOT on Amazon... ALOT, but no more batteries.",1
Less than wonderful for high current devices,"Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Nikon cameras it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.2V. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load.",3
batteries don't last long! Not a good Value,This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.,1
Kindle Kids,"Purchased this for my 18 month old granddaughter, had to return the first one due to it crashing. The second one has done the same , but plan on giving it a few more days before returning it. A little disappointed with it, expected it to be better than what it is.",3
Reliable and long lasting,"When I heard one of the consumer gurus on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the generic or lesser known brands of batteries were often as good as the name brands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other brands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosion. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries.",5
"not bad, but...","I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon.",3
good,"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product",3
"Perfect tablet for my kids, nephew and nieces.",I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.,5
Gotta get yourself one of these!,"This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!",5
GREAT!!!!,GREAT VALUE!!,5
Do not buy,"I only have it one star because I couldn't give zero stars. Over half of the box were dead. The ones that did work, only worked for a very short time. Do not buy these batteries.",1
Not as Quality as Name Brands,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.,3
Worst ever- no battery life- avoid these,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.,1
No Android support,"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money.",3
Great working tablet for the price,"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness.",5
Five Stars,Good product at good price.,5
Good for movies and amazon,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",3
Love it! So many!!!!!! Helps a lot to be in hand and not have to go to the store every 2 weeks :),Always a pleasure to have a near unlimited supply of batteries! Thanks Amazon!,5
Fast but screen not as big as ipad mini,"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this.",3
Not for me,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",3
Five Stars,Good very good,5
I love it!,I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.,5
Five Stars,Good performance. Good price.,5
Not long lasting,I will not purchase these again. They last about 1/2 the life of the Duracell ones.,1
leakage when new before use.,Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start,1
Great for 5 Year Old,"Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day.",5
Three Stars,"Doesn't hold the strength of Duracell, etc.",3
Three Stars,"Some work, some don't.",3
Bought these for my sisters day care. She said ...,"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received",1
Feels cheap,In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.,3
Perfect for child,It's ok just right for our baby I like we can set a lot of parental blocks,3
False advertising,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels.",1
Waste of money,"Four in the batch leaked and caused a mess in my charger and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn't hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews.",1
Batteries,Great price.,3
Not kid friendly,I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.,3
good value,"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine",3
I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them ...,"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other brands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies.",3
Three Stars,"Definitely are inexpensive, but we seem to go through them very, very fast. So... not sure.",3
PERFECT!!,My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.,5
"Great for kids, great price",I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.,5
One Star,"Idk why I ended up with AAA, when I orderd AA... Oh well",1
Leaking,"Maybe we have a bad batch because all the other Amazon Basics batteries we have are great.. So far numerous AA batteries are leaking in remotes, toys, and other electronics.",1
Fun technological assistant,We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.,5
Do not last!,I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.,1
Excellent tablet for the money,"Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend.",5
The battery burned me!!,I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.,1
A good improvement over previous models,"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books.",3
DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE.,"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios.",1
One Star,All were dead,1
Ok,I feel like they don't work as long.,3
Three Stars,Excellent price but DEFINITELY didn't last as long as popular/known brands.,3
"Horrible, do not buy","Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in AA and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. My battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn't take long before they stop working.",1
Great value and long lasting!,Way to go amazon! These Batteries are great!,5
Did not last,Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months.,1
Great for kids,Limited use if you dont want to enroll with amazon,5
Five Stars,as described,5
Excellent tablet!,Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.,5
Out of date,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.,1
"Good, but not great",I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.,3
One Star,Broke about a month after ordering them.,1
returned item,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.,1
One Star,die after one hour of use,1
Do you have great quality rechargeables,Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables,3
horrible,"Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless",1
Get what you pay for here,Great price but not long lasting in comparison to higher priced competitors. I got about 1/5 of the life I would with Duracell.,3
Not the greatest for kids,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.",1
Unit failed and Amazon will not support,I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty.,1
Great for reading online books,The tablet was easy to set up and use. Just the right size for travelling or relaxing at home. Great value for the price.,5
Three Stars,They ran out of energy very quick but it's a deal,3
Love the portability.,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that',3
Three Stars,Made in the USA would make this a 5 star,3
Five Stars,They are great at a great price.,5
you certainly get what you pay for... ...,you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me,1
good value deal,good value deal,5
Three Stars,Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(,3
The package was open and had no batteries....,The package was open and had no batteries....,1
Love it,The Kindle fire kids edition is a parent worry free solution to kids messing up potential settings love that you can set up a personal code and create multiple profiles,5
Best Kindle Yet - And Worth It,"This is my third Kindle, plus I have used the Kindle app on my two iPads and three iPhones. I always want to have a real Kindle so I will read in peace and avoid distraction from email, texts and such.This is much more readable that all of the previous models. The resolution is as good as I could ever want. The lighting is perfectly even and makes reading in any light (or lack of) completely comfortable. The screen response is almost perfect, but I am just getting use to the new side areas to turn pages. I love the weight and can read in any position, including on my back in bed, with one hand.I am perfectly fine with paying $200 for this Kindle. If you want something to read your books, and nothing else, this is the product for you.",5
Kids loved it,A few problems with games loading but over all good,3
Ads ads and ads,"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!",1
Great device,Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.,5
They don't last anywhere close to enegizer or duracell or sam's club brand batteries.,They don't seem to last that long as the ones you can get off the store. I bought them because I thought they were cheaper but Sam's club sells them cheaper and they last much longer.Update 1/10/2017Not only do they not last long but the new batteries that say are good till 11/2018 are pretty much dead without any use.Highly disappointed in amazon for this.,1
Kiddo LOVES it,Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.,3
did not hold charge,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. .",1
No like,This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me,3
but the good news is I now am the proud owner of ...,"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these",1
One Star,I have the wrong size batteries,1
Great Deal,"Great price. Not too amazing in terms of battery life, but I do not think that you could get a better deal.",3
Don't like...too hard to download other apps,"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.",1
Seems to be a good product. not sure they have a very long ...,Seems to be a good product. not sure they have a very long life.,3
Great for kids,Awesome device for my six year old. Very safe useage,5
Great tablet,My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!!,5
Good batteries,They're batteries. Excellent price and they work well. Will purchase again,5
"More options, more problems","I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price.",3
Five Stars,So far so good.,5
Garbage,Did not work.,1
Not to be modified,I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.,1
Not for kids,This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.,1
My daughter likes it,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids.",3
Very versatile,"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books.",5
Very Disappointed,Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.,1
Five Stars,great value,5
Great for kids,I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.,3
Kid friendly,Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.,5
Five Stars,Great value,5
No automatic restrictions for children,"I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+.",3
amazon fire hd8,meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.,3
One Star,they are terrible,1
a good stock pile of batteries for a decent price,"a good stock pile of batteries for a decent price. do not last as long as the 'name brands' but for the money, they are ok",3
Watch the quantity/size when ordering,"They perform well and the price is fine, but it's not entirely clear when it automatically switches you to AA size when you choose the larger quantity. Amazon snuck in a box of AA on me that way when I was expecting these AAA. Bad, Amazon. Bad.",1
Terrible Quality,Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.,1
Three Stars,maybe it's just me... but they don't seem to last very long,3
We always need this size battery and when the family ...,We always need this size battery and when the family comes to visit they snag for their electronics too. Thanks so much,5
Great product love it perfect for book lovers,Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips,5
Excellent product.,This was on my wife's Christmas list. She loves it. Easy to use.,5
Be careful about the charge,"My bluetooth mouse and keyboard eat batteries, so I liked the idea of a big pack that I could just leave in my desk. These batteries are pretty woeful, though, lasting only about 1/2 as long as the Duracells I get in the grocery store.",3
Batteries not holding charge or semi dead on arrival,I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment.,1
Good,It was ready when Target said it would be and the product is outstanding.,5
not bad,"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though",3
Happy Birthday to me,This was a birthday gift! It has nice visual features! It was easy to get started on it! So far so good!!,3
Christmas gift,"Can't wait to give to my son for Christmas! He's going to be so excited, great buy!",5
One Star,Great price but these do not last very long.,1
Five Stars,Seems to fix the faulty cable on my son's headset well.,5
MAJOR disappointment.,I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a ripoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor's batteries in before.....bummer :(,1
Great for younger kids,"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.",5
Good but a bit slow,Bought this for my my daughter. Good for slower games. Kind of slow loading pages and when watching videos,3
Short life,These things only last about a week in a Roku remote I will not be reordering.,1
Seem to Die Faster Than Name Brands,"I'm not entirely pleased with Amazon's batteries. It seems to me that these have been dying faster than the bulk pack I got at Costco long back (which lasted a long time!). I don't think I'll get these again, I'm returning to the name brands at Costoco once these are used up (and they are getting used up at a rapid pace).",3
"Good, if you get it on a sale","If you are getting this, get it on a sale!!It slow and choppy, but it's decent for light media consumption and browsing.",3
Not impressed,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.,1
Great Batteries at Half the Price,These work like any other battery at half the price! They are long lasting and easy to use.,5
Disappointed with Coverage,We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.,1
Buy the Name Brand,I find they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell.,3
Five Stars,Last forever-great buy.,5
Less power for the money,"Never had alkalines that die as fast. This has been consistent through the package, not just a couple of batteries. Same results when used in TV remotes, optical mouse, smoke detectors and small flashlights.",1
Don't waste your money. Can barely power a handheld milk frother. WEEEAK,"Awful. Bought these specifically for my very small milk frother, these batteries can barely power the thing! I used whatever name brand in the frother before this and it ran full blast. But with the Amazon batteries, it gets up to like medium speed and doesn't even last 1/2 as long. Will never buy Amazon batteries again.",1
Very Disappointed,Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.,1
Five Stars,Best batery,5
Gets the work done,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",3
Great tablet for my grandson!,I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!,5
One Star,Returned for later purchase,1
Love,Love my Kindle! So when mother table died I brought her this and now I don't get calls all the time to help her figure out where everything is,5
Great Device for What It Is,"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?",5
Not a good product,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",1
"It's an ok tablet, but very limited in apps.",I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.,3
Five Stars,Work as advertised. The days of spending allot of dough on brand name batteries are over!,5
Five Stars,"YES. Finally a battery that doesn't cost my immortal soul. But seriously, cheap batteries that last forever.",5
good value,"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine",3
Very Fast Drain,"I often buy Amazon Basic products, and until I tried their batteries I've never had a complaint. But these batteries drain faster than any but the absolute cheapest I've ever used. So no bargain there. You get what you pay for with this, unlike most other Amazon branded items.",1
These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as ...,These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.,3
Cheap and Work Great,"I've been ordering these cheap batteries for years for my XBOX controllers. They are cheap and long lasting, and I'll never go back to picking up batteries at the store again.",5
Amazon,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.,3
They don't seem to work except in very low energy ...,"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well",1
Good batteries,Good expiration time and they work great. Always impressed with AmazonBasics Batteries because the price is fair.,5
Excellent learning device for my son,My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer,5
Five Stars,"Great seller, awesome product!",5
Great games,Great tablet for a toddler to start on! The parental controls can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways!,5
Three Stars,they DO NOT last as long as Duracell or Energizer.,3
Nice Basic tablet,"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.",3
super,fab case for any laptop would buy another again i got it for my laptop and it is fine and strong plenty of pockets,5
Not so much,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started,3
Five Stars,Great value and fast shipping,5
Three Stars,GOOD AS BRAND NAME,3
Cute,Great price for product. It's get of you have kids.,5
Ease of use,Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic,5
Don't waste your moneykeep looking elsewhere!,"Very, very, very difficult to turn on and off, not sticky enough and kept falling down, complete waste of money.When I could get them on and they were sticking, the lighting effect was very nice however, the quality of the product was zero.",1
Five Stars,Work like a charm,5
Excellent tablet for children,I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.,5
Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it ...,"All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it that is useless, especially as a Prime member.",1
I am very disappointed in these batteries,"I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money.",1
Five Stars,They work well and they are a great price!,5
Wonderful tablet at a price that can't be beat,"(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one.",5
Ok for price,Picture quality seemed grainy. We tried streaming video on amazon prime with it and it buffered some times even though we have an extremely fast Wi-Fi. For the price though it's not bad. We use it for our kid's apps,3
Slow but good for kids,"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls",3
Three Stars,Runs out of power fast.,3
Five Stars,prompt shipping and good value,5
Three Stars,Put in my mouse for just 3 days. Power is off again.,3
good product and quick service,My nephew is going to high school and the kindle is a great gift for him. Bestbuy has good selection and the price is good too!,5
ho-hum longevity,Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.,3
Run out too fast,These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...,1
Neat tablet,This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.,5
Terrible,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,1
Kids gift for Xmas,She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so,5
Good for certain situations,"I bought this tablet originally because of its price. You get what you pay for. Overall, I thought it was a wonderful tablet but it didn‚Äôt fit my needs. I ended up returning it because I didn‚Äôt like the android software. This tablet is wonderful for children and the elderly, but for a previous iPad owner, I decided to buy an iPad and pay more instead.",3
Don't like...too hard to download other apps,"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.",1
inconvenient to Use.,I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.,3
Great e reader but a bit over priced,It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.,3
Nice Gift,Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.,5
Linky Battery Acid,The batteries linked and ruined my Game Camera. I think you need to replace my game Camera,1
An ok tablet,It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps,3
We buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we ...,"We buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us. Theseas as long as the dollar store batteries. Some items 2 weeks, others 1. I will not buy again.",1
Its a pain to use,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,3
"Nope, not again","3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.",1
Great value for great batteries.,Can't beat the value here.,5
One Star,Pretty sure they didn't really have a charge when they arrived,1
Three Stars,Use them on my outdoor solar lights. They lasted 2 weeks and they stopped working.,3
Great for my 3 year old,Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.,5
Drained at the start...,I've only found 2 out of the box that have lasted longer than a week!,1
DEAD BATTERIES,Bought a box of 36 aaa batteries and all batteries were dead. Don't waste your money. The only way I rated it 1one star is because it would not except ZERO stars which is what this product deserves.,1
Five Stars,Love it,5
Great!,"Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!",5
Horrible Battery Life,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,1
Woks great!,"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!",5
Slow performance,Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times,3
Three Stars,Not sure. have not fully tested the performance of this item.,3
Disappointed.,The price was right but they just don't last as long as the other name brand batteries so it's not worth it.,1
Quality control much,"I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again.",1
Great Tablet for children,"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made .",5
Not good,Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again,1
I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in ...,I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months. For now I'll stay away from this product and fork out a few more bucks for a battery from a main stream manufacturer.,1
These are the worst batteries I've ever used,Bought these batteries because of the 4 - 5 star ratings from verified purchases.....what These are the worst batteries I've ever used! 1 week of these batteries 1 month or more of brand name batteries.,1
Junk Probably half dead on insertion into your devices!,Absolute junk! My devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Save your money buy Duracell batteries from Groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don't know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible.,1
One Star,should buy duracell,1
DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY. All batteries arrived completely dead. I thought it might be a bad batch. Ordered more, all arrived dead.",1
send back,"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying.",1
great product,this is my second one and must have one of these at all times,5
"Works great, glad we bought it.","Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device",5
Five Stars,ok,5
Great basic tablet,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,3
One Star,Does not last as long as the good batteries,1
Great tablet for my 3 year old daughter,My daughter like her tablet it's so simple to use.,5
Great for learning to use computer,Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web,3
LASTED 4 MONTHS FOR MY XBOX CONTROLLER,"Literally. Bought these in May and they JUST ran out. These are great batteries (F the specs, I'll leave that to battery specialists. But these lasted way longer and better than a Plug and Play. Minus the cord when the battery died. Bought these again. Can't beat the price of effectiveness.",5
Amazon fire 7 for kids,"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app",3
very good deal.,These batteries work well and have a good life expectancy. Excellent product and great price.,5
Five Stars,Love having a stash on batteries,5
Come with ads on homesceeen,This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising,1
"Amazon produce are usually so good, but I would not recommend these","These are budget friendly but don't last! I bought for my battery operated candles that typically use batteries for 6-8 weeks. Twice these batteries barely lasted 1 week. It was so disappointing. Amazon produce are usually so good, but I would not recommend these.",1
Had to return in a week,This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying.,1
Great table for children,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.,3
Confused,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.,1
Tap - Fills a Gap That Didn't Need Filling,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",3
Wasteful,Have tried these in various battery powered devices and they fail very quickly. I won't use them any more as I don't like having to dispose of dead batteries,1
Average battery,"Decent battery, but seem to change them out a little bit faster than the big name batteries.",3
Love it,Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.,5
One Star,"These batteries are awful, have no power and die fast",1
"So disappointed in these, reviews weren't accurate at all!",Dollar store Sunbeam batteries lasted longer than these crappy things. So disappointing!,1
An excellant product.,This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.,5
Run out too fast,These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...,1
Returned,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item.",1
Ok for the price.,Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.,3
Out of date,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.,1
Three Stars,These didn't last very long.,3
Don't waste your time or money.............................,"I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money.",1
Three Stars,not much better than the dollar store brand,3
Kindle HD,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9,3

Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure,I'm not sure these are lasting as long as more well-known brands. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure.,3
Great,Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.,5
Great gift idea,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,3
Lack power for some applications,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal.",1
Great tablet,Got two for my kids for Christmas and they're awesome! And also got lucky they scanned to $20 less than advertised price! Woo!,5
Great device for reading and playing games.,"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other.",5
no show on batteries,"received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper",1
Daughter loves it,Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. $129.99 and even got a price adjustment once it went it sale.,5
Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 16gb - Wi-fi,The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!,5
Worst Batteries I Have Ever Purchased!,"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order.",1
Keeps turning off on its own,I bought this tablet to use with my 3 year old autistic son. I tried 3 different tablets and all 3 were defective. It would turn off by itself during a video. We were using It for his therapy sessions and this was very inconvient. Switched to a 7 and have had no trouble since.,3
"Easy to use, economical",My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!,5
Enjoy it,Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games,5
Amazon Fire,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.,3

Excellent for reading,Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time,5
expanded storage,"can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup.",5
I hate it!!,I had to buy a brand new bed after purchasing this item. It kept ripping up and the bugs kept coming from the tears in the case. I do not recommend this for no one.,1
Five Stars,service expedited,5
Fire Tablet,Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.,3
Quality not so great,"I needed some regular batteries to toss into random things where my rechargeables normally get lost and forgotten. Normally I prefer amazon's brand, but these white batteries were just not that great. Some of them barely worked. They were very inconsistent.",3
Short lived,Dont last very long,3
Three Stars,"Nice value, average life.",3
"Don't buy these if you want a lasting, safe battery","These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I've only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. None of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaked or corroded worthiness a few days. I've had much better luck with dollar store brands.",1

Batteries die very fast,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.,1
Good gift,This was a xmas gift and is a great gift for someone who uses kindle and Amazon.,3
One Star,almost most of the batteries drained out in 1 or 2 weeks with moderate use,1
I have the power!,These do the craziest thing. I put them into stuff that needs batteries and then the thing works. Great price and quantity.,5
Great product,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,3
Love Kindle!,"We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!",5
Perfect for a child,I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.,5
One Star,very disappointed in these!,1
Do not last,They do not last long at all. I have to keep changing them out on the products I put them in. Will not be buying them again.,1
Too many pop up ads,We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.,3
Nice,Works great,5
Worst batteries I've ever purchased!,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.,1
Leaked Battery Acid Every Time,Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.,1
It's ok.,"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.",3
Not good.,These worked for about a week. Then started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leaks of batteries.,1
Not so good!,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!,1
Come with ads on homesceeen,This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising,1
Difficult to learn how to play some of the games,Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.,3

Great first tablet for beginners.,"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store.",3
Great batteries! High quality,Great batteries! High quality. And so many of them! Have not had to replace any of them yet. I'm battery rich!,5
One Star,Tried them in 2 flashlights. Neither worked.,1
One Star,Awful batteries.,1
They go dead really fast.,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.,1
Crap,These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.,1
Sturdy Tablet,"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.",3
False advertising,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels.",1
Still figuring it out,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could.",3
Great budget tablet,Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.,5
Allows me to alternate printing from two printers near the computer,"This is a good length cable for those that don't want tight connections because a cable is too short. I alternate back and forth between using two printers so having a longer cable allows me to keep two printers near the computer.Setup worked flawlessly, it hooked up easily and the computer recognized the usb connection. I was set to print and have been enjoying this cable ever since.Final thoughts, the best length of the cable really depends on your setup situation but a longer one like this gives you more flexibility of where you want your attached device.",5
Five Stars,great,5
love my tablet,im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!,5
Waste of money,These batteries last 5 minutes. Waste of money.,1
Not so much,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started,3
Great everyday tablet!!,Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.,5
I recommend,They're perfect and I have to mention the price is great,5
It fits my need perfectly,"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective.",5
Good tablet for amazon users,This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users,3
This item is not my primary tablet but is adequate,This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.,3
Three Stars,works like any another.,3

My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.",3
durable and fun tablet for kids,I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.,5
Cheap but don't last,"These run down in my TV remote quicker than any battery I have used. TV says low battery within a week of installing. I will try another brand next time. Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later.",1
one of which was a good work flashlight,"Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good.",1
"1st purchase was good, this time they are junk!","First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries.",1
Won't order again.,I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my flameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. None of those worked either So I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.,1
Pass on these,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk,1

Usually a couple of bad batteries per 48,"I use these in a three battery work light and probably 2-3 times per 48 one dies much more quickly than the others. I put them on a meter and 2 have 1.25v left but the third has around .75v. Frustrating, but I think they're still a good value",3
Awesome tablet,"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far.",5
Not impressed,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.,1
Easy to access and set up. Love its simplicity.,Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.,5
Faulty,It already quit working. Will not charge anymore. I had to buy a new one.,3
Burned by fire,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad.",3

Five Stars,Great value. I haven't had any problems with them.,5
Don't bother,These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.,1
Okay Tablet,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.",3
Tremendous Value!!!,"Tremendous Value! My kids go thru AA batteries at a ferocious pace. Doesn't matter the brand, they burn through them. These last as long as what we'd previously buy at the store, but at a fraction of the price!!!!",5
Won't even run a smoke detector.,Put these AA batteries in smoke detectors and they immediately start the low battery beeps. Pulled them back out going to see about returning them all - or they will goto recycling. :-(,1
A disappointment...,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.,3
hey its a tablet,great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!,5
Very Disappointed,"I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users.",1

"I love you, but these batteries are terrible","Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC",1
Defective Batteries. Don't buy these.,"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out.

I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference ...,"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.",1
Good warranty and protection,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.,3
Really like the form factor.,Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight.,5

I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.,1
Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make ...,"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Every device I've used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned.",1
Hopefully they will be better than the previous version,These are batteries what else can one say did anyone get silver batteries instead of white Hopefully they will be better than the previous version.,3
Highly recommend!,"It's a bargain! Works just as well as regular, higher priced batteries for a fraction of a cost. Highly recommend!",5
Dead after less than two years,"With four kids under the roof, their toys are always in need of AA batteries. I had purchased this AmazonBasics pack of AA batteries for exactly that purpose. The expiration year reads 2024, but after just two years of sitting on the shelf, the batteries that are left are all but dead. They weren't left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use. It's really sad that they just can't hold their own after only two years. Will stick with known brands from now on.",1
Great value battery,Bought these for various electronics and so far so good. I use to buy Procells but they seem to not last as long and I wanted to try something different. Amazon seems to make good generic products and I'm happy with these batteries so far.,5

Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge.",1
Too may preloaded useless apps,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",1

Upon attempting to recharge these I figured out they aren't rechargeable (Once again big duh on my part)..Now I'm seriously surprised that I'm only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure.,1
Worst battery life of any battery. Only 25 compared to brand name.,What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased.

Experimental browser not great,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.",3
What a waste!,These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. What a waste!,1
Died in 2 days or less!,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.,1
All dead twice,All the batteries came dead so I did a return and got new ones. Second order was the same as the first.Update: still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks!!!,1

One Star,Inconsistent. VERY short life.,1
Utter garbage,"Aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an Android tablet would be able to get from the playstore, which was hilariously wrong, this product would never connect to the internet correctly. I had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it, starting from day one and up. My son loved having the electric device and I didn't take it back for those reasons, but now 60 days out, the thing doesn't even charge anymore and I'm having to take it back in. At least I bought the warrenty, because this is literally a huge waste of money. I'd rather have spent $500 on a different tablet than this garbage.",1
I do not like this tablet. Period.,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",1

Good resolution,"With the recent promotion for the Amazon Fire HD8 tablet, I just had to get one. It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box.",3
Love it,Don't know how I managed without Alexa. Everyone in the family is enjoying her.,5

May be defective,"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch",1

"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast!","Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",1
Not for overseas!,"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!",1
Very good product.,"Very good product, Good price, I would recommend this product",5
Five Stars,good value for the money,5
"Does what it says, missing one key feature",There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,3
Great Tablet for the price,Tablet could use a better speaker otherwise a great tablet,5
They don't work,"Mine don't appear to have a charge. I bought them for a plant watering system that takes AAA batteries. I tried three sets of these AAA batteries in the plant watering system, which works fine currently with rechargeable batteries. They alkaline performance batteries don't work.I was hoping to get longer battery life from these performance batteries but they don't work at all.",1
Not too bad,"Definitely not Duracell, but it gets the job done. Last for a while, but died sooner than expected.",3
Worst batteries ever,Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy,1
Why yet another charger,"No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended.",1
very happy with new Kindle Fire,This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.,5
Three Stars,Seems as good as Duracell but can't really tell.,3
Not the greatest for kids,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.",1
One Star,These batteries do not last or work well. Spend the extra buck and buy Duracell.,1
Basic battery life compared to bame brand batteries.,"I used these batteries in one of my game cameras, but the life of theAmazon Basic battery did not last as long compared to name brand batteries. I really don't believe they are worth the savings when the Basics probably didn't take half the pictures in the game camera as Duracell. I will use these batteries in remote and my kids toys.",3
Christmas Gift,I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now,5
Awesome,Great for kids. Bought both colors for two of my kids.,5
Five Stars,Great batteries,5
Best more affordable AAs,"OMG! these batteries are so affordable! And it may just be my biased opinion, but they seem to last longer than the Duracell or Energizer batteries I buy at the store (maybe because they don't sit in inventory for goodness know how long). Regardless, these are my favorite AAs",5
One Star,Good price with ugly design.,1
Nice tablet,Amazing tablet for mi 4 year old son she is happy!,5
they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are ...,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality.",3
why,did order or get,1
One Star,"Not universal. Did not work on garage door opener, given as gift but now cannot return.",1
ok,not what I was looking for but they are ok.,3
DANGEROUS BATTERY LEAKAGE!,"DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand...",1
not any faster,it does not charge any faster than regular charger.,3
"Great protection, decent performance",I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.,3
Five Stars,Thanks AAAAA+++++++,5
Perfect.,Great batteries at a great price!,5
Three Stars,The don't last as long as I'd hoped.,3
Battery Performance,"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. At first I has hesitant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong....",5
App options pathetic,Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed,1
Disappointed,Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.,1
It's no IPAD,Have owned IOS products as long as I can remember. Not on same level,1
Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home,These batteries work but don't really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home depot,1
Amazing product,This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend,5
Good First Tablet,"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK.",3
Yuck- wrapped in the box!,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.",3
Three Stars,you get what you pay for... they are not great,3
Returned,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item.",1
Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable,Put together mobile but it refuses to turn. Kind of pointless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable.,1
Poor charging,Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.,1
Nice price for the batteries,Just received them and trying them out. So far so good.,3
Three Stars,lower value as they last about one hour but good for a flash light,3
My kids love these,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",3
One Star,These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.,1
Decent Kids Edition,"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected.",3
"Great for reading, playing games and more","Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need",5
but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week,"Pros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Cons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week. I bought these specifically for my XBox One controller which is used daily for an hour or two on average.",3
Okay Tablet,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.",3
kids loved it,"great tablet for children, lots of content. games books etc and easy for my 4 y.o to use.",5
Good for the money.,"It's a fast tablet, but doesn't get all the games you can get at the play store. Many apps not available for Kindle.",3
Great for the price!,Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.,5
Great for learning to use computer,Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web,3
Great for a kid,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!,3
Just ok,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget,3
Great Price,I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone.,5
One Star,poor quality,1
Not Horrible,Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.,3
Product Issues,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,1
Short Life,"Cheap batteries, but they don't last long for me. I've been using them in my fire tv remote. I have to replace them every month. The batteries before these lasted for 6 months for comparison.",3
Power Up,"Uhhhhh, loads of batteries at a good price.",5
Perfect for my 4 year old,Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.,5
Now I have Alexa at work,"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",5
One Star,Batteries last for about 2 days in my Xbox one controller.,1
Kindle HD,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9,3
The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run ...,The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. A little disappointed.,3
Sad,It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped,3
Don't last. Go brand-name.,"These batteries don't last. They might be a good value but for me it's more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. If you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands Duracell, energizer etc. If you just want something that's cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer.",1
Not in love,Replaced a v1 nook but this is not better for reading,3
You might just get what you pay for...,"The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something.",3
The worst batteries that i have ever purchased,"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging",1
Great Tablet,Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it,5
Great for kids,"Excellent for kids! Tons of fun apps, videos and books. Love that it comes with a year of Free Time.",5
Excellent!,"Good, long lasting batteries!",5
Not bad,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.,3
Disappointing,Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.,1
Broke in 5 mos,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.,1
Great tablet,Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes,5
Not so great....,"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that.",3
Work as well as any other,"These batteries work great. 100 satisfied. I haven't timed them to compare them to others, but they seem to last a long time.",5
kindle,It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it,5
Great tablet,Love the different color choices eliminates having to buy a case kind of but fast speed n awesome products,5
garbage,"When I purchased the Fire Stick, these batteries were included. In less than three weeks they were dead and had to be replaced. The batteries for the Fire Stick are used only in the remote, so it is not as though they got much use! I would never recommend such a garbage product.",1
dont waiste your money they dont work or last for a very short time,"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible",1
Not meet needs,Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.,1
Excellent tablet for little kids,I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.,5
Sound quality horrible,It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it,1
One Star,Wrong Item,1
Great Product,I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do,5
Good for the price,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good.",3
"User friendly, easy set up","My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading",5
Great tablet for the price,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.",3
Ok for Kids,"Cant download many apps, but its great for kids or for those who like to read.",3
ok tablet for a small child,The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.,3
Not so good!,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!,1
Be aware these require a credit card,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it.",1
good tablet to star,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better,3
Poor quality tablet,I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .,1
Hard to beat for the price!,"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips.",5
Not a product for all Playstore apps,"I got the tablet for $50 but doesn't have the full Android operating system. Even with a software hack, not all the apps from Play Store were usable on this tablet. Returned it and got a Samsung Tablet.",3
Wait till it goes on sale.,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.,3
Three Stars,they seem to have a very short life span. do not think i would buy again.,3
Great batteries for Great price,Great batteries for Great price,5
Amazing deal,The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it!,5
Don't last long,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.,3
good price.,"Good price but quality is not really reliable.Some of them run out power real quick and others last super long.After 6 months storage, already have one pack of the batteries generates white powder type of corrosion (indoor, dry cool place, not used yet). Not sure it is quality control issue or stay in their shelf too long before shipping.",3
"Amazon Kindle, Black","For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",3
Works,A ton of batteries for cheap. They are working great so far in my wireless Xbox controller that I use for my PC.,5
Great,"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting.",5
Great for kids,Son loves it........................................,3
My 3rd Kindle,This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.,3
Great for kids,Great case.. took awhile to get to my house but after several delays it finally got there.,3
Three Stars,Worked great.,3
Ok but they don't last long at all,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.,1
died quickly,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.,1
DOA,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.,1
Very impressive....,I ran a test with these batteries because I was skeptical. I ran a Sennheiser wireless mic transmitter for nearly twelve hours and the receiver ran for over 16. These are great numbers. I can get through a full day of shooting with a handful of these.,5
Good but...,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.,3
Five Stars,Work great,5
Very good table for the price,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty.",3
Fits,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad,3
great. seems like a well made battery,"great. seems like a well made battery, great price. amazon had super fast overnight shipping.",5
Not too kid friendly,Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.,3
Not bad,"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this.",3

Wonderful product!,This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.,5
One Star,Worst batteries I've ever bought.,1
One Star,Batteries are awful. Might get 1/4 the life other batteries Ive used. Will not be buying Amazon batteries again.,1
Great packaging and tests show good value,"Love the fact that they come packaged 4 batteries to pack, put in a box that you can open and close. No more fumbling with batteries.",5
short battery life,short battery life,1
Awful Lifespan,Died after 5 uses in my coffee frother wand. Won't buy again.,1
Product Issues,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,1
Love it,Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.,5
Great Tablet,Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice,5
No complaints.,"Works as good as the higher-priced, name-brand batteries. No complaints.",5
One Star,Batteries were weak and didn't last a week in remote,1
When it works I love it,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,3
great childs tablet,my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.,5
Great,Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it,5
Worst batteries ever,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.,1
"Great 8"" tablet",This tablet is cheap but wonderful. I bought 3 on black friday just to give them to family members.,5
Great speaker,I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound,3
"iPad ""lite""","This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there.",3
Better to go with big brand name,Low quality batteries - they die after using a few times. Better to go with big brand name,1
Just as good as any other batteries on the shelf!,What can I say - they work and last just as good as any other brand I have tried. I bought various sizes from Amazon and they all work great - just make sure you buy in advance to have them on hand for when you need them instead of running to the store forking over a lot more money for the same performance - I did buy the 9 volt box to replace all my fire alarms in the house - PERFECT!,5
Three Stars,Don't last as long as Duracells.,3
"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast!","Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",1
Just what the Dr ordered.,So far. So good. Appears to perform as well as the national brands.,5
Five Stars,"great value, why pay for expensive brand when Amazon basic sufficient your basic needs :D",5
a Good buy,The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift,5
Not as Quality as Name Brands,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.,3

Can it be used with the library?,It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.,3
Great Black Friday deal,This is the best priced device that I found with the most functionality. Amazing black Friday deal!!!,5
I really like Amazon batteries,"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other brands, but at a much better price point.",5
cannot believe this is not included with the Kindle,Is Amazon kidding me They want me to pay 19.99 for an item that is a critical part of the functioning of their product Outrageous. I will find another 5V charger.,1

Terrible,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..,1
Beginner tablet,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok",3

Worst product,"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance",1
The batteries are the very worst I have ever used,"The batteries are the very worst I have ever used. I use a wireless mouse for work, and I've had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries. By the time you figure out how bad they are, you will be outside your return window. A fail for Amazon if you ask me, and makes me question whether I should keep shopping with them.",1
One Star,theses batteries don't last very long not worth the money,1
They don't last very long,Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries,1
Good tablet 4 kids,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,3
Great,This product is amazing ! My wife loves it! I would totally recommend this to a friend!,5
Kindle recharging cord disappointing,"I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all...",1
Great Product,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",5
Not worth a crap don't waist your money,Not worth a crap don't waist your money. I purchased these for under cabinet lighting and they hardly have enough power. The light is way more dim than other batteries.,1
good tablet to star,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better,3
"Some good, some bad","I'll give them two stars for the price, but you really do get what you pay for. These batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the Kirkland ones I got from Costco. Or, maybe it's just some of them that fail too soon. I put several new Amazon AA batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use. When a couple of those devices stopped working, I tested the batteries. In both cases, only one battery was actually dead, the other was fine. That seems weird, weird enough that I'll go back to Costco for my next battery purchase.",1
NOT WORTH IT,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",1
Quantity over Quality.,I think the price is really good for the amount. But I feel the battery life is not as long as my preferred choice of battery. Will go back to my original choice of batteries.Besides that I did not have any issues with them and they are perfectly good working batteries.,3
Ok tablet,"I wish the tablet was faster and more consistent. It is ok as a first tablet, but not for someone who has owned many and wants to do many things with it.",3
Not enough storage,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working.",3
awesome bundle with amazon kids content,bought on sale. amazing value of device + kids content + 2 year full warranty.one caveat : when traveling outside the USA most of the content does not play.,5
Great deal,"We have a lot of baby toys that are battery operated. Amazon to the rescue. Now, I can keep them all working",5
Great for kids!,My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!,5
Disappointed in it's performance.,"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again",3
Great first tab,Great first tab for game playing and basic web surfing. Enough speed to navigate the web and for multiwindow tasking.,5

One Star,these batteries don't last very long,1
Amazon Fire Tablet,Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.,5
No thanks - not again.,"these apparently have been sitting around for some time, I used 2 in a TV remote and they were almost dead within just a few days. I exchanged the two for two more from the same pack, and again about 3-4 days later they were dead. hereafter I'll buy a name brand.",3
Bad lot of batteries,These batteries are bad. In any device the last only a very short time.,1
Half dead if not dead only half filled,By far the worst batteries I have ever bought I regret my purchase of 2 packs! Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life! If u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks!,1

Charging Ports,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.",3
Great product,My kids loved and i very happy for this tablet. Thanks,5
Don't last long at all,Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead.,1
A Kindle that's kid resistant,A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.,5
Not looking too good...,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.,3
Three Stars,Did not last,3
"Don't buy, get rechargeables. It'll save you a lot in the long run!","You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don't last very long, I'd spend the extra and get rechargeables.",1
Nice tablet for 6 year old,"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app.",5
Great for a kid,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!,3
Five Stars,These seem to last as long as name brand batteries and the price is much better,5
Three Stars,Doesn't last long at all,3
Not what I expected,"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading.",3
Five Stars,"These batteries wor great on my tv remote. Until they die, then you have to replace them",5
Great for the kids... no Google Play Store,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",3
Perfect,Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere,3
Good,Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen,5
alright tablet,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users.",3
Good for movies and amazon,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",3
These batteries don't work as well as Duracell,"These batteries don't work well! My bluetooth mouse wouldn't stay on any more, even when I put fresh Amazon batteries in them. So I bought a new mouse and it wouldn't work with the new batteries. Then I used Duracell and the mouse was fine!Same thing happened with my Roku remote.",1
good,good batteries good price,5
Don't last,"Terrible. Don't hold their charge, I change the batteries in my remote once a week. Will not be buying again.",1

Three Stars,I'm super charged over the price of these batteries!!!!,3
Abysmal battery life,"Lasted about a week in my electric toothbrush. Energizer and Duracell brand lasted a month. Tried with 4 different Amazon batteries, same results. Very dissatisfied",1
One Star,never again. don't last. especially short life in cold weather.,1
Fits,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad,3
Three Stars,Lasted half the time as duracell in the same product,3
One Star,Cheap,1
Disappointed,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it,1
Great value,Nice value for these batteries... they all work well and last and the price is perfect! We always have to stock up on batteries for Xmas gifts so this was a great way to do that.,5
It's an ok tablet for the price.,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.",3
Processor is slow,"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version.",3
Excellent introductory tablet for youngelr kids,"Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit",5
Not sure about these yet. The question is whether ...,Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.,3
Great tablet for the grandkids,Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.,5
Spend the extra money get good batteries.,"These don't last long, wouldn't buy again. Spend the extra money get good batteries.",1
Terrible,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..,1
Handy and fun.,I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.,5
Great,Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much,5
Three Stars,good price and they are as good as the major brands,3
ok but could be improved,I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all,3
One Star,Died almost immediately. Ruined their purpose for the purpose needed.,1
One Star,They die quickly,1
The tablet not so great as mentioned,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow",1
Another win for Amazon,"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.",5
"Great tablet, great price!",Got this for my grandmother who's not very tech savvy but she was able to learn how to use it quickly.,5
"Like the size, features and price","Had to order on line, since I wanted a yellow Fire. Works well and way expected. Only comment is the battery seems to go faster than expected.",5
Horrible! Did not last 1 hour,"Horrible! Did not last 1 hour, in my devices. DO NOT BUY!!",1
Save your money and electronics!,"Ordered these for my son's remote control truck. Put them in both trucks and within a week the batteries in both trucks exploded, ruining both of them. So not only am I out the money I spent on the batteries I have to buy a new truck that costs 50. Spend the extra money and buy Duracell!",1
Super slow,It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.,1
Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon ...,Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.,1
Three Stars,Not as strong and not lasting long enough as the major brands.,3
Very disappointed,"I hoped that an Amazon-branded product would have decent quality, but these batteries are just terrible. Their charge will last for about 1/10 of the usual top brands. Very disappointed. I'm never buying an Amazon battery again.",1
died too soon,"the last time i had batteries go dead so soon were the ones i purchased at harbor freight.. i had to change the batteries in a comcast remote every 2 weels and in my digital camera , without the flash after 20 shots..",1
Three Stars,They're batteries.,3
"Nice Light Weight & Size, but missing options","I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it.",3
Dead out of the package,"The batteries were not operable out of the package. Thought it was the appliance, but replaced with other batteries and it worked fine. Luckily, Amazon's return policy is amazing but I doubt I'll try another one of their Basics brand items anytime soon.",1
OK For Entry Level Tablet,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.",3
Poor power,Terrible life. These are poorest quality batteries I have ever purchased both AA and AAA,5
Kind of complicated,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.",3
Dead after 3 days,Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.,1
faulty Amazon AA batteries,"mu AA Amazon batteries made in Indonesia were without power after 12 months, bought in May 2016",1
"Its not an android, but it'll do","Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50.",3
We are enjoying this product,It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.,5
Powerful Buying Experience,These batteries work as I expected.,5
Much slimmer profile,best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had,5
Good but...,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.,3
half don't work,some are not functioning,1
What happened to the green and silver Amazon batteries,"What happened to the green and silver amazon batteries Those worked great. These new ones are terrible. Very short battery life. I've been through two boxes of 48, thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time, same results.",1
"Low powered, not good","Used it for a mouse - works OK. I have a battery powered egg beater and when I put these batteries, the beater did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!So, I guess these are low powered, Very disappointed",1
Five Stars,Great Packaging. They Are Lasting,5
It's fair,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,3
Poor quality,Batteries leaked when in charging station.,1
Good for everyday use.,Just regular AA batteries at a decent price.,3
Three Stars,Does not have same charge as top brands. Caveat emptor.,3
Great for children,I bought this for my daughter. I like that there are security features. She enjoys it and I have peace of mind!!,5

One Star,Tore within one week and is baby blue and very shear not green.,1
Excellent gift,"I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it.",5
Certified Garbage!,"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something.",1
Worst Fire Tablet of all,"I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on.",1
Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",1
Five Stars,great product!,5
"less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast!","Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",1
Font size changes with no way to lock it,There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.,3
Ok for what you pay,Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do,3
Great buy!,Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus,5
But...,"I love Amazon. I am a prime member. Have had an amazon credit card for 16 years. Think their service and pricing is second to none.But.... these batteries are garbage. Gar-bage.They really don't work or at the very least don't work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal AA would. Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don't put any faith in them.",1

Charging Port Does Not Last - Not good for kids!,I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.,1

What makes this a kid edition??,"7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge.",1
Easy setup,This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.,5
Buy a protective cover!,"This is not the first kindle i buy, but the others were for my kids or gifted to kids so they broke at some point.

Terrible,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,1
Buyer beware,"These are wretched batteries. They typically last only two weeks in a TV remote control device, they can't power a computer's mouse beyond a week, and I have serious doubts about their shelf life. Packaging is nice, though, sort of like The Washington Post.",1
WORST BATTERIES EVER.,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME.",1

Three Stars,I don't feel like they last as long as the name brand batteries.,3
"Does what it says, missing one key feature",There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,3
Kindle fire 8,Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks,5
Leaked Acid,Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund.,1
DOA,DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. What a disappointment. Threw them away. :(,1
Third fire,Fire is great for books also good for photos and google,5
Rating still pending,"Haven't used many of them yet, but the two or three have have used seem to be fine.",3
Happy customer,Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.,5
Great Tablet!,"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!",5
HD makes big difference,"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her.",5
Great,My son loves it. The picture and quality is great and my so loves all the apps from the characters he loves,5
Ok product,"Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok",3
Good buy for the price,"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.",3
Dont use for childrens toys,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.,1
Not long lasting,"Ok for general use, but does not last long.",3
Awesome.,Still running strong after I had a string of battery-operated lights on for a whole week (in 8-hour shifts of darkness).,5
One Star,these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market.,1
great tablet for the money,"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet.",5
Good price. Battery life an open issue.,"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life.",3
Amazon fire 7 for kids,"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app",3
I don't understand all the great reviews,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.,3
For my sister birthday,This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.,5
Good but not great,Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.,3
Works great,Cheaper than other brands but work just as well. Will buy again!,5
Have a few days to charge it?,"I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before.",3
Five Stars,okk,5
Three Stars,OK for AAA needs,3
DID NOT receive the AA BATTERIES honest to god!!! :( which sucks bc I need them and my AAA batteries,DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!,1
just wish they would last longer.,"Cheap AAA batteries. Really shouldnt expect much, just wish they would last as long as comparably priced batteries. I use them for the light i wear on my head at work. Typical AAAs last 6-8 hours constant use, these last about 3-4.",3
Good for a quick fix,"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. If you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less.",3
Love them,I have been buying AmazonBasic batteries for a few years now and love them. Great price and I have found the batteries last just as long as the name brand ones and cost less.,5
Won't unlock,"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.",1
Love this tablet,I really love this tablet it is a pretty good size and it has a good amount of internal memory and has been able to do everything I have wanted it to do this far,5
Nice Gift,Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.,5
Great for my grandkids,My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel.,5
One Star,These batteries have a very short life. Need replaced every week. Used ina solar light outside Very unsatisfactory,1
great value - awesome product,great value - awesome product.they seem to be holding up as good as any namebrand batteries at a fraction of the price.,5
Sucks,"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks...",1
Not buying again!,Doesn't last as advertised. Dead in no time!,1
"These are NOT rechargeable, even though they look similar to those.","This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference.",3
OK,It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!,3
Good price,"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook",3
Doesn't last,These die SO fast.,1
Its a gamble.,Lights worked well but the ahesive didnt stick on about 90 of the lights backing. The 10 that did. I tried to adjust the lights and they ripped.,1
Good for nights out,Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.,3
Awesome,This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.,5
Five Stars,As expected.,5
Batteries popped and got acid all over.,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.,1
"Tablet worked as it should, but...","I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet.",3
Perfect to stockpile,Any parent of toddlers knows that there are numerous toys that require AAA batteries. We have these always on hand and this price is too good to not stock up. My son even loves sitting down and watching the whole Changing batteries process. Thanks for keeping these so affordable!,5
"Great Price, OK tablet","If you want a basic tablet this is perfect for you. However, if you are heavily invested in Android, this tablet will disappoint. Very Amazon driven, runs slowly with Android software sideloaded.",3
On Fire,A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!,5
Love it,The parental controls are amazing! Super easy for my daughter to operate,5
died quickly,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.,1
Excellent product but granddaughter wanted an iPad,I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.,5
Great for kids,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.,3
Five Stars,Great price!,5
Crap,These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.,1
Long lasting and very economical battery.,"I needed some AAA's and decided to go with these since I no longer have an acive COstco membership. So far these batteries have held up very well in my remotes, several headlamps, and tactical flashlights that I regularly use. Great purchase",5
Three Stars,Very poor batteries. I ordered a box and so far about 50 are either bad out of the box or very soon after.,1
E Tablet,Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .,5
Great everyday tablet!!,Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.,5
Three Stars,There ok.,3
Pass on these,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk,1
Internet connection shotty,I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!,3
Good for beginners,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it.",3
Love it!,"This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps.",5
Five Stars,batteries needed,5
Great buy,Best bang for your buck............................,5
Basic batteries,"What we expected, a bargain battery, so we are happy.",3
Stopped charging in under 6 months,"The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!",1
Great bargain tablet.,"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!",5
A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS,A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS DESCRIBE,5
Great tablet,It's so easy to use and fun! I watch shows on Netflix and MTV apps,5
Not reliable,"Some work, some don't. Some will power my TV remote but the same batteries wouldn't power a different type of remote. I won't buy these again.",1
Great first tablet for beginners.,"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store.",3
Great bumper,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.,3
horrible batteries,"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free.",1
It's ok,Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.,3
Very good,The service was great and the help I received thanks,5
Three Stars,"I haven,t had them long enough",3
Fun,My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained,5
Great,Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much,5
Disappointed,"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE",1
Solid tablet,I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues,3
Love the Kindle Fire.,"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it.",5
Was I Disappointed. How about a replacement for these fake batteries ...,I used the batteries in my flameless candles 3x for about8 hours. Total bummer! They all died. Won't purchase again!Amazon should reconsider selling these turkeys Wow. Was IDisappointed. How about a replacement for these fake batterieswith real ones!,1

Confused,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.,1
These batteries don't last long at all.,I bought these for my cameras. They don't last any time at all. I won't buy these again.,1
Can't connect it,We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.,1
Did not last long,"We used in an August smart lock. We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks.",1
Waste! Must use right away!,Stopped working after 6 months. Had to throw them away. What a waste.,1

I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids.",3
Love the batteries,"Love the batteries. Not sure what else I can say about them, they work -- Ill have to post an addition to let you know how long they worked.",5

They work and they're cheap,"They work and they're cheap, but Duracell lasts longer.",3
Not for me,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",3
"Good for the buck, but mediocre at best","Bought this to replace my aging Nexus 7 (2013) version, but didn't hold a candle up to it. I knew it going in, but wanted to see for myself in person. For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8"" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now.",3
Love it and can't live without it. User friendly.,Easy to use and love all the things I can do on it.,5
Three Stars,They run out of juice fast.,3
Great deal,Great batteries. I have re ordered many times.. they are just as good as enegizer !,5
Not up to the Amazon brand.,"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!",1
Pretty annoying!,"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!",1

They Leak - Pretty much the worst.,These batteries leak. What more is there to say They are the worst. Do not buy these.,1
Don't Buy,"These straight up don't work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear.",1
Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four ...,Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.,3
Good for movies and amazon,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",3
Doesn't work for me,"This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it.",1
An ok tablet,It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps,3

You get what you pay for,"At first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basics line of batteries. Reasonably priced and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell.",3
Logo doesnt last.. good part though,"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so..........",3

Not pre-charged,My 8 pack batteries were NOT charged so if you are buying these for a trip or something be warned.,3
Five Stars,excellent product,5
"Great for some applications, but not the longest lasting","Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remotes in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices.",3
Had trouble with the batch I bought. Didn't last very long in remotes.,I was very surprised as the batteries I got were in date but didn't work very long compared to a generic AA drug store variety. Probably just got a bad batch but I ended up replacing them very quickly in remotes especially.,3

Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat.",1
No impressed.,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.,3
Great Gift Item,Pursued as a gift for nephew. It's durable build yet lightest was exactly what I was looking for. Display is sharp and crisp/,5
Five Stars,Can't beat this price! These batteries work just as well as other more expensive batteries...Will definitely order these again.,5
BUY DURACELL and not these batteries,These last about a week.,3

Great price.,Duracell quality. Great price.,5

LONG LASTING,"THESE BATTERIES WORK JUST AS GOOD AS THE BRANDS YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT DO NOT COST NEARLY AS MUCH MONEY. THATS A WINNER FOR ME.",5
Battery sucks,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.,3
My Sister's gift,I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!,5
What happened to AmazonBasics branded batteries Where did the quality go,I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.,1
alright tablet,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users.",3
Does not work well for multiple children,"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.",1
They last a very short time once in use. ...,They last a very short time once in use. Put fresh ones in a soap dispenser and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months,1
Three Stars,sticking to longer life energizers,3
Excellent for a 3 yr old,"Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver.",5
Not what I expected,"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading.",3
One Star,I was missing a pack of 4 batteries when I opened the box today. Not impressed.,1
One Star,Did not fix my leaking water pump,1
Last about a quarter as long as name brand batteries,"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time",1
Amazon Batteries Are Crap in Amazon Remote,"My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries.",1
Five Stars,Good product,5
Three Stars,Batteries seem to die quickly.,3
It's an ok tablet for the price.,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.",3
Very good and can't tell any difference...........,"So far, these batteries are very good. I like to have a large quantity on hand so I don't have to always be buying a battery. The price was real good and I have nothing negative to say.",5
Gift product,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",3
Good price,Goof,3
Love it,"Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well",5
Great buy,Work as expected. Great buy.,5
2 weeks at best.,These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. 2 weeks at best.,1
bang for the buck,for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!,3
Christmas gift,This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.,5
I was very disappointed.,These batteries were expired dead when they arrived at my house. I was very disappointed.,1
Battery be gone,I change the batteries at least once a month. These things eat batteries like crazy and are hardly used.,1
Amazing product,Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it,5
Do not purchase.,They do not work. I had to buy Duracell,1
Five Stars,Good deal,5
Excellent tablet for kids.,My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.,5
Great for my 5 year old,"Was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own Ipad or the kindle. I'm so glad that I picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. She loves it too!",5
cheap battery power but they don't last well,cheap battery power but they don't last well,3
One Star,Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak,1
so good!,"So far, so good!",5
Not to be modified,I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.,1
Three Stars,love it,3
One Star,Batteries didn't last long at all,1
Great for the price and the kids,"Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week.",5
So-so,My kids go thru a lot of batteries. These are good for the wii remote and other items that do not draw a huge power source but flash lights and the such seem to go thru them a lot faster.,3
Love kids mode,I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts,3
They're batteries,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know.",3
Five Stars,perfect,5
Too good to pass up!,"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members).",5
Shoulder Strap not included.,"Nice bag, however did not come with the shoulder strap, which is one of the main reasons I wanted this particular model.",3
My kids love these,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",3
Five Stars,Batteries. They work.,5
Very Poor,First eight batteries I tried barely had a charge at all! Don't wast your money.,1
Five Stars,These are great batteries at a great price. Enough said,5
An average Fire tablet,"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option",3
One Star,batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed,1
Worst batteries ever,"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money",1
Great,This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.,5
One Star,Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak,1
excellent item,It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use,5
Wont charge,I tried recharging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I'll by my rechargeables elsewhere,1
Just OK,"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price.",3
Be aware these require a credit card,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it.",1
One Star,they don't hold a charge like the top brands do.,1
They are stand AA batteries that offer amazing performance at an amazing price,"There isn't much I can say about these batteries. They are stand AA batteries that offer amazing performance at an amazing price! At 0.34 (normally 0.43) cents a battery, not only are they comparable to 1 batteries (Usually 0.25-0.50 cents a battery), but they are much more heavyweight and they last a lot longer! Between the 4 of us, especially our 2 kids, we fly through batteries like water and when we find a discount brand we like, we hold on to them tightly! I will be purchasing more AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries especially with the Holidays coming. They are inexpensive, high quality and worth every penny!",5
Not the same,Isn't the same as the picture.,3
Not what I was looking for,"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.",3
"Stay Far, Far Away from these batteries","These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt.",1
They WILL burn up or electronics,Burnt up a copper string light I have been using for a years. Short life on other electronics compared to Duracell. Left in a wii controller for 2 months and leaked all over.,1
Great tablet,Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone.,5
Three Stars,1,3
Great,Great for ebooks and games also social media times,5
One Star,That's crap,1
One Star,Run down very quickly!,1
Not kid friendly,I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.,3
Great for prize,Works ok. Doesn't last too long,5
I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend. The split ...,"I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend . The split open and ruined who uses them in a 200.00 portable modem. I would of sent them back, but this happened after the 30 day return window.",1
Great tablet for the price,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.",3
Very slow,"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality",3
Great Gift for a pre teen,Bought 3 for different and after 3 years mine went kerplot gona get new upgraded one for Christmas this year,5
Good for 4 year old,This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.,3
good however not sure of life of batteries,"so far they are work well, however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries.",3
Great book to take anywhere,"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere .",5
Nice tablet for the price.,This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.,5
Very poor performance. Would not recommend.,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these.",1
"Nope, not again","3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.",1
it is a good idea to stock up,"Well, it is a good idea to stock up. I didn't do comparison to see if it was cost effective.",5
"Not very long lasting, at least for gaming",I used these in my Xbox controller. Hardly ever lasted more than 2-3 weeks if I play regularly on weekends and a couple weekdays.,3
Grading: Price A+ Life: C,"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months).",3
Bargain Batteries,A lot of batteries for a little money. What more could you want,5
good starter tablet,"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it",3
Great tablet for my son,This tablet is just the right size for my son's hands. Easy for him to use,5
Love it,This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.,5
Not user Friendly,"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs.",1
Five Stars,Works just fine,5
Great inexpensive tablet,"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size.",5
Terrible. Avoid.,"Can't believe Amazon's name is on these pieces of dung. Very short life. I've migrated to Eneloop rechargeables for AAA as well as AA now big savers, as I have a lot of doodads.",1
Five Stars,So far appears to be excellent batteries,5
Good luck!,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get.",3
great Amazon device,"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!",5
GREAT VALUE,BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.,5
Skip,I use AA batteries in my double electric breast pump. I usually have to replace Duracell every 3-4 days but these I had to replace every 24 hours or so. Truly did not last long!,1
Three Stars,Not all that long life.,3
Three Stars,They don't really last to long. But for the price....,3
For the little ones,"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine",5
Should've been included with the Kindle purchase.,"One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity.",1
Great,"Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight.",5
love them work great but while charging they leaked all ...,love them work great but while charging they leaked all over the charger and had to just throw 8 of them away,1
Disappointed,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/,3
stopped working after 3 weeks.,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,3
Great!,Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!,5
Great tablet for school age,"My granddaughter loved her tablet and the color. It's amazing how easy it is for her to use, perfect birthday gift",5
Kindle fire,Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.,5
Nice and compact,The HD tablet is just right for a child who is being introduced to the computer word.,3
"Very poor performance, not very long lasting.",Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.,1
Not for me,"Returned within a week, did not like it. I didn't care for the ads every time I turned the tablet on.",1
Longest lasting Batteries ever!,Longest lasting batteries I've ever used. I bought them for my Xbox One controllers which I used for hours at a time every day and I replace batteries maybe once every couple weeks.,5
Ended up returning,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.,1
none of them work.,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.",1
Good,It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab,3
Five Stars,Awesome product I would recommend this to anyone.,5
dont last as long as I expected them to.,dont last as long as I expected them to. they are in our fire stick remotes and i have to change them about every 2 or 3 months,3
Haven't set it up yet,It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.,3
Five Stars,Great price! Seems to work perfectly...and c'mon 48 for under 14...can't beat that with a stick!,5
Three Stars,Works,3
Great general tablet choice,"Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features.",5
One Star,"batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month",1
Three Stars,Great price for the quantity but it seems they don't last as long as the major brands.,3
Hidden fees,After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.,1
Love this tablet,"My 20 year old daughter loves this tablet, from reading to internet surfing to watching movies. Worth every penny",5
Three Stars,These batteries are reasonably priced but I found they do not last as long as other batteries,3
Early Demise,"Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package.",1
Decent enough,They die pretty quick in certain items. But decent price. Nice packaging though. I'd probably buy again just for remotes smaller items.,3
Very disappointing purchase,"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me.",1
Perfect for streaming movies,Use this on flights to watch movies and pass the time!,5
Three Stars,Weird but some didn't last long as they should,3
Good for kids but SLOW,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine.",3
good tablet to star,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better,3
Just decent tablet,Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...,3
One Star,don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.,1
